Over the years though, there are some disturbing things that I have found out, that happens in this country we all call home. The elites in the private sector and the public sector are legitimately the dumbest people I have ever seen in my life, perhaps in the whole world excluding Africa. They rely on the rest of the population as their crutch, to make up for their incredible amount of incompetence. That has led the Republic of Mauritius to be a country of mediocrity, that after 56 years of independence is completely stuck, because these dumbducks are holding it back. The country we live is not progressing anymore. It has not progressed at all for years. This country's elites are so incompetent, that the government is willingly encouraging people to leave their own home, by making their life harder and facilitating more imports of foreign workers in every sector, because they are much easier to exploit. It is akin to hitting two birds with one stone, given they also push people, who in all likelihood would not vote for them. Everybody knows, the imported labor are underpaid and overworked. Do you understand, how unkind these people at the top are? They would do it to you too, if labor laws were not here to protect you. So with you, they change tunes, they will tell you, you are lazy, they will demean you, you are apparently a bum --- When the bitter truth, is they cannot afford to pay you a decent living wage, because their costs would increase too much and they would go bankrupt. Because of their own incompetence, not yours. They need slaves to compensate for their incompetence.\n\nIt's not like this country lacks competence today. There are very competent people waiting on the sidelines, to be able to get the opportunity to help their country. You, the young people of the Republic of Mauritius, who eagerly waits for someone to recognize your talent and reward you for your true worth. You need to accept that you need someone competent to be able to do that. Unfortunately, kindness, in and of itself does not actually exist. What exists is competence. You can only be as kind as you are competent in this world. A dumbduck, on the other hand, cannot be kind. Dumbducks exploit people. Dumbducks is all this country has had for 56 years. Nobody wants a real democracy, given they simply cannot thrive in it. They would go from being a minister to working for slighlty higher than the minimum wage. It is very a fucked up situation to be honest, which is why I have in the end taken it upon myself to do it. You have a country filled with undeserving, incompetent people hogging all its wealth and bullying the rest of the population. That, rarely ends well for both parties. True, it is dangerous given I could get Kistnened, but at this point, I know too much to turn a blind eye. I am competent enough you see, to not need anybody currently in either the private sector or the public sector. You see, I am interested, in a Mauritius that does massive semiconductors manufacturing. Cars manufacturing. Electronics manufacturing. In letting a multinational like Intercontinental Exchange, open a clearing house here called ICE Africa, to establish Mauritius as the core of Africa in Finance. I am interested, in a Mauritius whose population is closer to ~6-8 million rather than the 1.3 million it currently is. I am not interested in the periphery Mauritius, that you come to, when you setup some funds here, to evade taxes or launder some dollars that you steal from your people home country as a statesman. In the periphery Mauritius you come to, to do textiles manufacturing. I am simply not interested in menial labor intensive manufacturing which is what we currently do. I am simply not interested in the Mauritius that exists today. It is ugly. It is hell. All it does it exploit, exploit, exploit. I am not interested in the dumbducks or their future, wealth or prosperity. I could not give less of a fuck about protecting their interests. I am interested in you, the young people. The math majors, the physics majors, the STEM majors. The social science majors. The management majors. The marketing majors. I want you to realize, you are all smarter than the dumbducks. You are not a phony. Believe in yourself. Indeed, I am interested in you, the future of the Republic of Mauritius. Because I cannot do this alone. I need you, the competent people to take a stand. Together, we can rebuild this country.\n\nBut you must understand, the very conumdrum that this poses for the dumbducks. You see, this country is not a free market, like it so claims. This country is tailor made for some people. So tailor made, that the government had to literally destroy a conglomerate called British American Insurance, to prevent it from becoming the leading conglomerate of the Republic of Mauritius. This is how tailor made this country is. You are really in a prison, if you are educated enough to see through the facade, that the dumbducks have set up. The majority of the people in politics in this country are families and related. Almost all of them have never brought anything to the table besides history, that is their father's or mother's name or the fact that they were related. They practice a modern form of inbreeding to keep their inner circle small, because only two political parties have a sway in the country. Really, when you look at it objectively, Mauritius is really just the Europe of the 1780's-1800's. It is disgusting. It is abomination that must end. All the laws, are carefully drafted so that the chosen elites have zero competitors and enjoy monopoly. Trademark laws or what is known as patent exhaustion is carefully made so, you cannot be a competitor to someone representing a brand from abroad. How is this a free market ? It is not. It is just one of the many many lies the country perpetuates. A very old lie, I remember, that was popular when I was young -- is that it is the only country in the world where education and health were free. Your parents believed that lie. Even my parents believed that lie. But that is all it ever was. Lies. It is called propaganda. Propaganda exists to manipulate uneducated people. To make sheep. Slaves. Truth is, most country have socialist policies. All this country has ever really done is copy laws from other countries. Even copying was something, we were purposefully bad at though because, if a law was too good, it was modified to be less likely for stealing to lead in a successful convinction down the line.\n\nTruth is they lie, that is all they do. They are good at it. That is the only thing they excel at. I guess stealing public money is another thing most of them excel at. They make shit up to seem competent. They will pay a shit ton of money to get into a university, earn a piece of paper to fake their competence. Things are so bad that these days, some outright fake the fact that they do not even have the qualifications they claim. They fake the paper altogether rather than just faking the competence. That is how incompetent our country has become after 56 years. Unfortunately, because our parents were not given the chance to have the education we have been offered, they bought these lies for 56 years. They could not see through these phonies. They though, that these people are the best of the country. That they are competent. A lot of people actually believe that. That some politicians have saved our country. That they are the reason Mauritius progressed. You cannot hold it against your parents, to have been sucked in communalism voting. Everybody was sucked in from that generation. They got sucked in, because they could not know better. They were denied an education. This was their education. To be RACIST. They were indoctrinated, by the politics of the Republic of Mauritius for 56 years. Most old people in the Republic of Mauritius are extremely racist. You should however, never hold it against them. They did not choose to be racist. They were forced to be racists. We would all be racists too, had we been given the same education our parents and grand-parents were given which was not one. It was a school of propaganda. Of castes. Of religious hate. Of sowing the seeds of discord and violence. Of encouraging discrimination. It is how disgusting, the politics of that generation was and still is to this day.\n\nFor all those reasons, it is unlikely that your parents, would understand any of this. Because they are victims, in all of this, who have been abused by politics for 56 years. They do not have the required education to be able to process all of this. They cannot understand that, they have been lied to, played with, toyed with for 56 long years while the resources of the country was mismanaged by all the governments. Just like they cannot understand that the government is fooling them by using printed central bank money to increase their pension which will only increase the cost of living and make their life harder, not easier. But it seems destiny had other plans for you. I want to be very clear. Yes, the current government will go down as the worst in the history of the country but other governments stole just as much by funneling public money into their close circle's bank accounts by being intermediaries rather than service providers on all tenders that the government puts out. Do not be stupid, by thinking there was a ''good government''. Good governments, do not exist. That is why laws exist. Good laws is what the Republic of Mauritius need. Nobody has done anything though for 56 long years, because they all enjoyed stealing the resources of the country when it was their turn at bat. Everybody has stolen money. You live in a country where the top companies has continuously went bust for over 56 years only to be given your hard earned money so they can do it all over again. That is the law of the Republic of Mauritius. In it, you are a prisoner if you are not born in some select families. If you do not somehow suck up, to the right person, suck some bick if you are extremely unlucky, your ambitions will always have ceilings. Competence is irrelevant in this country. Because dumbducks do not have it.\n\n# The Monarchy of Mauritius\n\nIn essence, what has been happening in Mauritius for 56 years is what was happening in Europe when Kings existed. The monarchy was filled with dumbducks. They had to put their people through increasingly more and more misery, as time went on, the more they let them rule and bully them. It is literal hell these days if you are someone young looking at what the Republic of Mauritius is turning into. Dumbducks will often talk of ``experience'' because they do not have anything else to offer. They legitimately know nothing. Well, I guess I am being unfair. They have experience in [how to forget they stole public money and deal in all the drugs imports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Mauritius). The most ridiculous thing about all of this, is that they believe they are fooling you like they fooled your parents for fifty six years. They are arrogant as duck. They are killing people literally with all the drugs. They will not stop bullying you and killing the children of this country until you do something about it. I do not want, this country to end like Europe. These dumbducks do not deserve, you sullying your hands for them. Do not even think of violence. I will show you what exactly you have been voting for 56 years. I will show you the truth of it all. The rest is up to you when election time comes. Your vote will decide the destiny of the country. \n\nThere are a lot competent people today in the Republic of Mauritius. But they do not come from the right family. They do not come from the right race. They do not come from the right caste. They do not come from the right skin color. In the past, all these things, these made up bullshit arbitrary rules, like caste, religions were used to brainwash your parents, to divide this country, so that the dumbducks could rule. Politicians made this country more and more racist because it was the only way for them to win for 56 years. We do not have to continue with that tradition of doing politics with race and religion. I have no need for it, and I am hoping you will not need it too after I show you, how by bringing race, caste, religion into politics, we have been condeming this country to misery. I am hoping with your help, we can truly turn a new leaf, where we will live by new rules. Namely, of letting education finally do its job. Of allowing competence to bloom. It is time for you to understand the prison you live in, so as to not repeat your parents' choices for 56 years that have shaped your own destiny, to bring you here. Helpless, with no future. Do you want your own child to go through this kind of abuse tomorrow again 56 years in the future ? Then it is time to stop the bullies.\n\nYour parents could not understand these simple truths because they have been brainwashed. They cannot understand that American presidents have in no way shaped the success of America like its people and its immigrants. They cannot understand this bitter truth, that is nonetheless true --- That The Republic of Mauritius has only been held back by its politicians for 56 years. None of them have contributed so much as a single percent of growth of output. All of them have misused the resources of this country. They have condemened it by their actions to become as poor as it did today. That is simple cause and effect. Basic science, your parents cannot understand. Dumbducks have condemened your life to become so hard. And it will only get harder, each extra day you allow them to bully you. The dumbducks are the source of all your misery not all your success like your parents have been brainwashed to believe. The only hope this country has today, is if you, the young people of the republic of mauritius, take a fucking stand for your future. To say no to the dumbducks. To say no to the bullies. That is all these politicians and private sector people really are. Bullies using the state's resources, to their leisure. \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” -- Charles Dickens -- A Tale of Two Cities.\n:::\n\nCharles Dickens, was only able to write a tale of two cities, because the bullies always existed. Dumbducks always existed. Do not think, this is different from what is going to happen elsewhere in the world. The dumbducks of this world are on a clock.\n\n",
