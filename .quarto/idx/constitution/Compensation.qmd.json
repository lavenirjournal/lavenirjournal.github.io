Rather general schedules will be created consisting of grades, steps and benefits and a single mechanic of revaluation applying to all schedules, as shall be ascertained by Law. \n\nGamification principles shall be used to ascertain the skills and education each grade requires, skills being fair to man and woman.\n\nEvery public and para-public sector job shall belong to a schedule and have a grade attached to it. Steps shall be based on lengths of service. \n\nAll forms of remuneration of elected officials shall be public as well as their pensions.\n\n:::{.text-center}\nSection 3\n:::\n\nTotal pension to be paid for the service of an elected official after his term ends by the state using the people's money shall be calculated using the following formulation being careful to always take highest pension $p_{h}$ to the lowest pension $p_{l}$ in the following fashion. This shall be applied on all pensions as if they always lived under such regulation.\n\n\\begin{equation} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{p=h}^{l} \\frac{1}{n} p \\end{equation} for $n$ starting at 1.\n\nAll past elected officials and government officials of the First Republic of Mauritius who profited through the existence of the First Republic of Mauritius receiving a pension paid by the People of the Republic of Mauritius shall have the possibility to relinquish all future cash flow of their state pensions as compensation in a quid pro quo restitution in exchange for immunity against prosecution for their past financial crimes whereby money was expropriated from the Republic of Mauritius.^[ Think about it. ]\n\n\n:::{.text-center}\nSection 4\n:::\n\nThe base pay of the President shall be based on the median income of the top 10 domestic earners. Said number shall be discounted by 40\\% and then multiplied by 2 to get the Presidential basic pay.
