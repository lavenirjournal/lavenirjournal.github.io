Meaning my aim is to bring \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega \\; | \\; B )\\) as close to 1, as I possibly can, by getting more and more people here represented by \\(B\\), to read this website.

If three quarter of the house shall vote in the yes, to transition to the Second Republic then a process called the constitutional convention shall start. During the period of the constitutional convention, the state shall run on the old constitution with the old laws. The constitutional convention shall open this constitution to the scrutiny of all and need the co-operation of all parties in parliament to fill the remaining gaps present so that it may be used as a precise foundation for the Second Republic.\nAll the additional laws that will be most necessary so we may transition, to a precisely defined Second Republic shall be referred to as organic laws, and will be kept separate from this main constitution so as to always encourage every citizen to take the time to read it owing to its short nature, to learn of the rules governing them and of their rights.\n\nSection 2\n\nTo be deemed an organic Law, a bill shall need the concurrence of three quarters of the National Assembly. Likewise modifying an organic law will have you needing to wield three quarters of the votes in the National Assembly. All organic laws will need to be verified as to their precision and correctness, by the Supreme Court, vis a vis their need to exist expounded by the original constitution, before they can be officially promulgated.\n\nSection 3\n\nTo become the official consitution of the Republic of Mauritius after the constitutional convention, the population will need to vote on the matter via referendum. If a majority shall vote in the yes, We shall be governed by the new constitution and its organic laws.\n\nSection 4\n\nThe National Assembly whenever four fifths shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this constitution. The sitting President’s duty shall be to educate his people in good faith, on the exact implications of such amendments for six months. His purse to do so shall be adequate. The people shall vote after six months after the day the amedements shall have been proposed. If a majority of the population votes in the yes, the amendments shall pass.

What I have explained to you is the fate of all countries with a low capital-output ratio. The fate of such a country is that it tends to win its race to zero growth and once that happens it does not generate enough real savings anymore, and so it will start to fail to converge to become an advanced economy because of Debasement, Debasement, Debasement, Debasement, Debasement, Debasement, Debasement.

Then we are going to do great things together you and me, and make this country the core of Africa. As you know, the power of science comes from the fact that by explaining to you what happened to the Republic of Mauritius, I simultaneously explained to you what has happened everywhere else in the world with a low KY ratio, like in Lebanon, Bangladesh, Turkey, Sri-Lanka, Egypt, Argentina, Nigeria (The entirety of Africa actually). You should learn to appreciate the fact that science is not at odds with god, and embrace science to be able to understand nature. All science does is omit the definition of god to focus on understanding nature, solely without any distraction of the religious kind. But to say that, all that is happening is being determined by god itself is not something science could tell you is wrong. Plenty of scientists believe that. I believe that. Sir Isaac Newton believed that and he is the most intelligent human being to have ever existed. So you are in good company. To say that God determined that all the countries that I have mentioned above would remain in the dark and collapse without their people ever truly finding out the objective reasons as succinctly and as clearly as you have is a fact.\nNow, I do not know why things were destined to happen this way. I am just as much clueless as you. I am not more special than you or anything. I am just some guy fighting for his country’s freedom and future. I am fighting for my future and my kid’s future. What I can do though, is give you my opinion on the fact that for some reason, We the people of the Kingdom of Mauritius have been given an incredible blessing after 56 years of oppression. I know it can be hard to digest it this way when your retirement has been ruined, your insurance money has been ruined by inflation, your investments have been ruined by inflation, your wages have been ruined by inflation, your entire life has been ruined by inflation. I get it, trust me I get it, how hard life is currently. The inflation is the same for me too. But we went through the same thing in the 1980s, only we did nothing about it then. Not to sound arrogant or anything of the sort, but clearly nobody truly cares about us. It was this easy to win the coming general elections. Did you see anybody do what I just did? I know for a fact that I am not a smart guy. I’m relatively dumb. Anybody could have done this and yet this is the problem with our ‘experience’ heavy politicians. That is just the truth. What the hell is the politics of this country doing exactly for you right now? Creating meme accounts on facebook ‘pou jete labou lor zot l’adversaire’.

If I had been born in the inner circle of politics of this country, I never would have written this and risked destroying the very privilege I would have depended entirely on and thoroughly enjoyed. So you see, there is no other way for me to look at this, other than this has all been god’s plan to liberate our country. Many people will probably wonder what I believe in, religiously. I told you at the very beginning that I believe in the absence of free will, that we are all controlled by god and there is a passage in the Mahabharata where such a philosophy is beautifully exposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMahabharata - Book 3, Varna Parva, Chapter CLXXXVIII\n\n\n\nI am Narayana, the Source of all things, the Eternal, the Unchangeable. I am the Creator of all things, and the Destroyer also of all. I am Vishnu, I am Brahma and I am Shankara, the chief of the gods. I am king Vaisravana, and I am Yama, the lord of the deceased spirits. I am Siva, I am Soma, and I am Kasyapa the lord of the created things. And, O best of regenerate ones, I am he called Dhatri, and he also that is called Vidhatri, and I am Sacrifice embodied.

Governed by my ordinance, men wander within my body, their senses overwhelmed by me. They move not according to their will but as they are moved by me.\n\n\nHowever, that can be something that is considered taboo to accept, because to accept it is to relinquish the responsibility of the human being, which is why we might never accept that everything is moving out of its own accord. Some will come up with “I did not do this crime, god made me do it”. That view while technically correct is misplaced because such people do not embrace or understand what the absence of free will means. They are getting philosophical rather, about the ramifications of a world where nobody was ever in control of their actions, but nature has already made provisions for it. God has already made provisions for it, because if there is no free will then only god could have invented the rule of law, as well as all the various religions and everything else in the Universe which includes the illusion of free will. And as crazy as it might seem, only god truly judges people then through the judges he created and the rule of law that he created. When criminals get away with things, it is god’s will. What do you want me to tell you? That is the world we live in if it is to have a god. The most important point though that you are missing in all of this, is that the absence of free will means that things can be explained. Human behavior can be explained scientifically. Nature can be explained, and the motion of planets can be explained. You do not do anything randomly and that is exactly what the absence of free will is all about. You are governed by your brain and the instructions if you will in it or the latest version of the software called ‘You’, that your brain uses at all times. On a simpler note what I believe as god can be simplified as the Universal Form.1 To me the meaning of moksha is to let go of everything and acknowledge that ‘tou dans lamain bodier. mo pa parfait, mo role, li ekip moi au mieux pou mo faire moins pecher ki mo capav permet moi fer dans sa lavi la’.",

    "text": "The principle of least sins\nNow, before we move on, using simpler and more common examples of life in general, I would like to showcase to you how powerful the absence of free-will can be to understand the world we live in. Like I have said numerous times in these papers, one can only be as kind as they are competent. That is a way of thinking about nature where you acknowledge the absence of free will. There can be no morality if there is no competition because people are not free by design. Competition is the most important constant that morality depends on in the world. If giving you ultra processed foods comes at no cost to the bottom line of companies. Companies are just going to keep killing you. You do not believe me? Look at what is happening with climate change. We need that damn carbon tax. Just as a human being cannot love everybody (sorry, politician-kun) because nothing bad would happen in the world then. Contrary to popular belief, anything is not actually possible in real life. That is just how things are, there are probabilities rather, to various events that can happen at all times based on who I am and my patterns of behavior, my habits, my likes, my dislikes and my competence. These are all important logical things that are very easy to come to in the absence of free will because even though it is not provable empirically, such an assumption nevertheless keeps on delivering a more robust understanding of nature to us every time we use it. It is a simplifying assumption in trying to understand the world without all its chaos. You can continue to believe that you are freely determining your actions and only use this simplifying assumption to understand the world that you live in. That is fine as well because it does not matter in the end. What must happen will happen.\nFor example, your previous leaders could not impose the death penalty on the hard drugs (heroin, cocaine, synthethic, meth, fentanyl). But I do not need an income stream that kills this country’s children, I can afford to just invest my money in US equities and make enough money that way just fine because I know how to do it. Do you get it? I’ll impose it no problem by law on these hard drugs, and decriminalise cannabis, so those kids dealing can be reskilled and transition into legal work and have a real future. It was that easy, for 56 years. All you needed to do was put someone up there, that did not need that crutch. Similarly, abortion rights for example, is a topic in Mauritius that does not get enough attention. Do you know why? Because it does not matter for rich enough people, although abortion is illegal, they have it very easily without a hitch. But what about women who are not as rich? They have to risk their actual life, and immense emotional trauma. Have you ever aborted a baby? I know people who have and it is not easy to do it alone. It is not easy to dump that child (no I will not write the other word). If you do not know that then you would not understand how dangerous it is and how devastating it can be. But your right to privacy will be protected by section 11 in the Rights of the People in the Second Republic and districts cannot take it away because of section 4 of Decentralization. Every women will get to choose, in the Second Republic. I believe the choice should be given to every women out there, and whatever they choose is none of the state’s business.\nEspecially because in cases of sexual assaults, when the body of a human being undergoes freezing, be it a woman or man, that is not the woman or man, not trying to get up and leave, there is no get up and leave in practice, there is the brain and its chemical response at that moment, which you are absolutely not in control of and your body’s response controlled by those chemicals is to be forced into a freezing state to survive by appearing the least harmful possible. You cannot understand all of that without our simplifying assumption though. That the body acts as if it were dead and so does not resist anything at all. You would speculate all kinds of useless rubbish to be honest with you. Psychologically, the aftermath, the chaos, can be absolute torture to a woman when she goes through this again in her mind, because she will torment herself, as to why she did not leave. People will gossip about her if they learn of the incident, whispering that, that is what she was looking for, so she will question her sanity, will fall into a depressive episode, need to start heavily medicating herself, and eventually, she might even attempt to kill herself from her guilt eating her insides every day as she suffocates more and more from being unable to let go and move on from the fact that her body did what it needed to do to survive. To live another day because that is how the body interprets sexual assaults. As if it is going to die. My point to you in all of this, is to embrace that life can be understood and explained. Because it is how you level up. Honesty with yourself is the only road that leads to not repeating the same mistakes over and over again. People tend to think the social world is clouded in mystery because it is filled with lies, but it is not a mystery. It has objectivity too. Like our country’s economic status. All lies on paper, but with objectivity, you get the truth. Now, no one out there is perfect. We are all incredibly flawed and can only grow by understanding the world more and more as it is. Not as you wish it could be or should be.\nYou might be wondering by now, so are we not going to appeal the heavens? Obviously not while I am around, I will never tolerate that kind of meaningless violence on my watch. But you must understand that, this is not the case at all for our King. The reason why our country has fully transitioned to a Kingdom is correlated one hundred percent to the fact that we have not had much of any GDP growth for like 10 years now. That is the cause of everything that you are living into today. The standard of living has completely collapsed. The repression of information, the repression by the police, the torture by the police that goes unpunished, the increased drug addicts around the island, increased accidents, increase in infections and deaths from diseases, the decrease in education standards, the increase in stillbirths, the increase in the malnutrition of kids, the increase of botched operations and health malpractices every day, the lack of medicine in hospitals and the increasingly less clean island we have today. Everything will get worse when economic growth disappears. That is just cause and effect. How could he establish law and order when he himself has been lying to you for ten years now? He cannot do anything about anything, because he is not competent enough. His hands are tied, when the PC takes your money and buys cars, or god forbid anything else. When any of his men abuses a citizen, when they do unspeakable things to innocent citizens, when they abuse their power to intimidate innocent citizens. Your King cannot care about you nor can anybody else in the Republic of Mauritius because his own insecurities about the truth ever being known will get the best of him. The same is true of all dumbducks.\nThey cannot be moral. Your parents have been constantly electing people who cannot in any way care about their well-being for 56 years, they screwed themselves, over and over and over again. Why the hell would they do such a thing? Why would they screw themselves over for 56 years? They could only ever have done that because they are not doing anything. They did not do anything, because they are not in control of their own actions. You have to be able to see that what ruled their behaviors was their carefully setup environment (the indoctrination) that they went through. The communalism they went through. It is not your fault or your parent’s fault. Give yourselves a break. You have all been living in a prison, for 56 years, and I do not say this lightly. That is not a hyperbole for me. In any case your parents are not the villain of this story. All of these behaviors were governed by the education your ‘ruler’ allowed them to have, over the years. In Mauritius it was to keep your parents stupid and uneducated so that they would not see, that phonies were in charge. Dumbducks are the villains, make no mistake.\nThe only real risk that remains now, at least to me is the behavior of political parties. If you remember at the start of all of this, I told you that all the politics in our Kingdom can be summed up as closed-circle family inbreeding. I was not wrong, given what has recently transpired in July, but we already knew these things. You already knew them. As we know, the entire country knows who killed who. These things are not coincidences. For an entire country to know who killed who and yet for justice to not have been served. These must be carefully orchestrated things in the shadows by people holding guns to other people’s heads metaphorically. There is no other logical explanation. You have to understand that our country today is the far west basically, because it has not had economic growth for such a long time. Anything goes because there is no questioning the authority of some people in the police. Your King if shit hits the fan has only the police to use as a shield. As human bodies, he can throw at the population. That is a fact and why law and order is nonexistent. That is irrefutable proof that the law does not work in our country, anymore.\nHow the hell can a country, accept a meaningless statement that a man gave a husband money for the employment of his wife and get away with it, with the benefit of the doubt? That is the weakest defense to have transpired in a court of law, in human history. How is it that Danish prosecutors have already found BWSC guilty and nothing has even started here?. This can only happen when these are orchestrated things. Like invisible forces in the shadows, cleared the court’s schedule so that they could move very quickly because if it had dragged on for let’s just say 3-4 months, then the media would have discussed this ridiculous defense in detail, and the population’s eyebrows would have raised eventually. So to be clear, we will never ever appeal the heavens, because as a general principle, we will always walk the path of least sins, while they walk the path of maximum sins, HOWEVER we will respond in kind if our King does not count those ballots on the same day when polls close. Pull off any anything, and you will get a taste of the wrath of this country for those last ten years of suffering. I mean if he has the touper to print money again in secret, what could be off limits to our King? Nothing. Too bad though, God has decided otherwise. There is no winning. Our King will lose and a Republic for all citizens will rise.",

    "text": "The Grace of God\nNow, you might be worried given our King is a well known master manipulator. What if he requests the assistance of India with a pitiful excuse, to oppress us. India will not get into a country matter nor support one person if a whole country is against him. My Bharat, your Bharat, the Bharat we all know will neither support nor condone slavery. They will remain impartial and let general elections happen as the greatest democracy in the world. Bharat will do what is best for Bharat. Remain impartial. So, No India, No USA, No France, No UK, No nobody. This is between us the people of the Kingdom of Mauritius, our King and his dumbducks and the polls of the general election. We are going to do great things with India, America, Europe, Asia and everyone else who wants good relations with our country in the future. My responsibility hereon is to do what is best for my population. I could not care less about what is happening anywhere else, nor how a country does what it does. My responsibility is to make your lives better. One can only wonder though, why now? Why did god give us this opportunity now? Why not fifty-six years ago? Why not twenty years from now?\nThat is anybody’s guess. I wish to be clear that you should not take my opinions on destiny as gospel. They are my point of view and are a logical interpretation based on my understanding of the world. Just because I am being logical does not mean however that this is the answer. Commenting on destiny is a philosophical exercise. There is no right answer, technically. I would encourage you thus, to disagree and have other opinions on why we ultimately got this chance from god. Have your own interpretation, that is much healthier. I believe that it was impossible for us to become a democracy before today, because nobody wanted one. You think everybody has always wanted democracy, but that is not true in my own personal opinion, no one actually wanted a real democracy for 56 years. We actually liked communalism. Communalism has not stuck around because of our politicians alone. It cannot be just the indoctrination that made it a fan favorite. It was its objective usefulness to most people. It stuck around for 56 years because it was the best system for the people of the Republic of Mauritius back then. There was no one with much education back in the day compared to today. We did not want competence as the metric that jobs use, because nobody had qualifications, degrees, or doctorate. But the ambition was still here. We wanted communalism to be able to get ahead in life.\nYou see, back in the day, people knew that communalism would allow them to get ahead in life. They had ambitions and they did not care that communalism is a vicious system given that it is only ever at the expense of minorities, so the majority back then of which almost no one had a good education, loved it. The probabilities of what they could achieve were much higher with communalism. It increased exponentially. That is infact the biggest problem today given our economy has no more economic growth and opportunities have become much more scarce. This fact that it still is the better choice, you get me? Coller Lafiche is still 10000x more prosperous than getting a degree. That has not changed yet, and that is what this country’s young people are extremely mad about. They were lied to for all these years, by this country’s dumbducks, who lied to their face about getting a degree to be able to get ahead in life. They did not. They got behind, they lack experience because they wasted so much time toiling in school and must today work for chump change because the politics of this country does not give a damn about them at all. They are all slaves of the system today and they want justice and fairness. I am going to give it to them. The road ahead is extremely hard because the worst is yet to come in our soon to be Real Republic. We must pass the darkest hour first, by responsibly dealing with everything this government has done and work on re-establishing the people’s future to then be able to go into a new dawn and a new future, where our aim will be to become the core of Africa.\nThe path ahead is not easy, because we will inevitably need to ask for help in the future, the current situation is much worse than that of the 1980s because of the amount of debt that hangs over our heads and our children’s heads. We will need financial assistance from the IMF and to get it the IMF will logically demand that we increase our potential output growth rate. To do that we will need to bring our RER down. To bring our RER down? Ding Ding Ding, we will inevitably need to devaluate our currency. Now we will also need to fiscally consolidate to rebuild a capital base that will form our basis of investment so that we can take 2 to 3 steps back to be able to take a much bigger leap forward. That is how it works always, the first few years are the hardest, because you need to cut consumption to increase your savings, but fairly quickly you’ll be able to get to a much higher level of consumption that way. The government will still do everything it can to support the population to ensure population growth. But pensions will not move anymore, you have to realise that you got played hard, and you never got anything, they increased your pension on one side and printed money on the other side, effectively giving you a whole of disrespect but not much else in reality. If there is a need for it, because adequate nutrition is essential for all children so they can not only grow up healthy but live to their fullest potential be it education-wise, sports-wise or anything else, I will consider doing SNAP locally because it has too much literature going for it to deny its objective need to exist everywhere in the world, but that is it. But stop expecting too much from government. What you will get will be enough because inflation will go down and we will adopt a 2% inflation regime. I am not going to lie to conglomerates either. Forget generous subsidies you have gotten from the current government. Stop expecting the state to be your daddy from now on. Get good to continue enjoying the privilege that god bestowed upon you or get lost. You will need to sell equity hereon, to raise any money when you need it. Your cost of capital will not be subsidised. All I need from you hereon is for you to have a real presence on world markets that stems from this country which brings in a shit ton of foreign currency through production. I do not care who it will be, whoever does it will receive a lot of support from the government at any scale. Cutthroat capitalism is what this country will turn into. The best will get everything. If you feel like you are the best, then you have nothing to be scared of.\nWe need to put a pin on real estate for now, and anything that has to do with services and ‘beton’ in general. You can continue to do it, just do not expect a single cent from the state or any kind of favor. Besides healthcare reform where I will bring national health insurance in and we will do away with this ‘free health-care’ propaganda, services are just not something we can care about for now. I like South Korea’s system of National Health Insurance and their way of working with the private sector. I do not like free stuff because is never truly free. Free stuff breeds complacency and an attitude where you do not feel the need to understand things. You are just given stuff in your lap basically which I do not like. I want people to feel like they have a right to complain to hospitals and want to empower them to be able to keep their public hospitals in check. To do that, you have to get rid of the propaganda word ‘FREE’. We’ll say universal healthcare from now on. Universal healthcare we pay for ourselves with our tax money. We need to encourage people to assert their rights when they pay for it with their tax money. Have you ever noticed, that we are a very passive bunch? All of that passiveness stems from free stuff and things falling into people’s lap. Are you curious as to why? Do you know what is the objective similarity that exists between every societal structure out there? Be it political, religious, social exist solely because they gamify the world we live in and thus allows for an efficient managing of chemicals in the brain with the big 4 being (Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin, and Endorphins). Ergo consistent and predictable behaviors, patterns with the inevitable occasional chaos to it (crimes, love, accidents etc…). Socialism manages DOSE really well and turns you into well behaved children basically by giving you everything in your lap. Leaving that aside, our only focus is to have a real industrial base. Maybe some housing reforms here and there.\nWe need a capital intensive industrial base. How do we do that? That is a two-fold challenge. Of which the first is the need to secure enough domestic demand, because we do have not a lot of it clustered around here. But it is not doomed either, madagascar and reunion are a few hours away. We must pull these countries up by trading with them more and more and more. We must lobby France extensively in that it could be part of the African core if only it encouraged more people to move to Reunion and that there is a lot of tax and output to be had there. A lot. If between reunion and us, there were at least ~10-12 million people, and we added madagascar to that as well. We won. That is it. We are extremely safe from any conflict that will happen in the world because we have India, the US and France watching our backs. We are the safest place to do business in Africa for the next 100 years. Supply-side costs will only decrease with a competent government. We will however need to do good on our commitment to a few things, for the manufacturing to come. First is a commitment to population growth. Second is a commitment to free trade, maximum competition, and cutthroat capitalism. Third is a commitment to a stable democracy with sound government finances. Fourth is a commitment to find a pool of highly skilled workers. Number Fourth is by far the biggest challenge because we are dumb. We need some kind of free trade agreement with an advanced economy that has labor mobility eased into it so we can tap into a pool of highly skilled workers to develop a capital-intensive industrial base reliably. Eventually, it would also help us develop the financial side of it after all this is said and done. That is step two though and is a long way ahead. By that point, our current account will have turned into a current account surplus. There are many ways to try to coerce the world to come here, but I am not going to write each one down. I gave you the deterministic win condition. If we achieve it, then we will become the core of Africa. That should be enough of a plan for you for now.",

    "text": "The Old Guard\nYou probably do not like these guys called the dinosaurs. How could you, they never gave really cared about you for 56 years, no matter what they say. You are probably disgusted by the labour party and want to give away your vote to someone else. I cannot tell you that I do not understand you because I have felt the exact same way too. That is why I decided to pick up my old dream and decided to commit to the labour party. Again I do not know if I will be accepted, so I guess the better analogy is I decided to get up on my ass and fight for my future myself because I finally realised that our country was filled with dumbducks. Most of the old guard are dumbducks. So what? Get the fuck up too and fight for the country you want to exist tomorrow. Get used to the fact that nobody cares. If you want something to happen, make it happen. Be the change you want to see in the world.\nLook, let’s be honest with ourselves, corruption has always been here, our parents just did not care about it. For us, it mattered much more because we grew up with the correct definition of democracy. Because we watched American and European tv shows, so we held our politicians to a much greater standard than our parents ever will when we judged them. All politicians of the old generation have fumbled. I cannot do anything about it. You cannot do anything about it. What do you want me to do kill them? Is that what you want? Then what? Ruin my life and yours because of some dumbasses? I am not a King. Just let it go. Leave the act of bestowing justice to god. Let’s focus on reconstructing this country from scratch. For some reason, god has given them the opportunity to wash away their sins by liberating this country. So we can change our future together, by breaking this cycle of debasement and breaking away from being a dynasty. I know that permanently changing the future comes from the old guard letting go and retiring when we get to the second republic. Do not worry, put your trust solely in me henceforth, I will make good on that, I will ensure it but you have to understand that if you are in awe of me. Your parents for some reason that I do not understand and will probably never understand, are in awe of them. I cannot, not respect that if I am to do what is best for our country. We need them to transition into the Second Republic without a hitch. Without a war. We need to rally everybody around the labour party. For that to happen, we must all behave like true adults, true patriots and leave the arrogance behind. Accept our flaws. Humble ourselves and just do what is best for the betterment of all.\nDo you even realise how deep of a financial hole the country is actually in? You do not. I do. You cannot have pride right now. You have to act like an adult and compromise for your own good. For your children’s own good tomorrow. So, tell me now, why should you penalise your own future, and the future of the Republic of Mauritius because of the actions of some dumbasses in a political party. That dumbass tomorrow could be me for all you know, I cannot predict the future. Look, these people have messed up. I admit it to you given they probably never will. But you cannot expect them to admit it to you given the law fumbled too. You have to accept that. In the eyes of the law none of them are criminals. State prosecution could have gotten them but they rushed without being sure they had a solid case. You have to understand that prosecution is an art. When one commits a crime, there can be hundreds of potential charges that could be brought forward and prosecuted, rarely though will the hundred charges result in a conviction in the end. Most times you will only have a solid case for one or two charges at most. That is because Actus Reus, and Mens Rea conditions in White Collar crimes are ridiculously hard to prove beyond a resonable doubt. Your lovely state fumbled lots of such cases, either voluntarily or out of sheer stupidity. In any way, let it go.\nSo to sum up, these people we the young generation dislike, they command the vote of a lot of the elderly people (50+). The likelihood of your parents understanding what I have written here is less than 10%. Your parents will not understand the maths or what indoctrination is. They will not understand reason. Do not bother them. Do not pester them. Just respect your parents. Be grateful that they are in your life. Love them. Appreciate every moment you get. What we will do rather is to use these people as they used our parents, we will use them as our crutch. You should not expect me to become the leader of the labour party overnight. Do you even realise how honest I have been with you in these papers? You know more about me than literally anybody in my actual life. Clearly, I am a bad politician, given how honest I have been with you. I kid you of course, but you know do not expect change overnight, change will come. I am here now. I will dedicate the rest of my life to turning this island into a true paradise minus the communalism. But political parties are not really parties on this island. The first thing is to turn the labour party into a real political party and cut the inbreeding. That is not easy. Luckily there are more of you than the elderly and your number will only increase hereon. So if you want that precious democracy of yours to spread everywhere like wildfire going forward. Let it be written on all the walls, shouted in all the streets of our soon to be Republic, let it be goddamn known, who alone holds your vote now. Be proud and exclaim with pride that it is the future President of The Second Republic of Mauritius, Yuuki. And always remember if you want to lead this country one day. You are not allowed to be a pussy. You have to be bold and honest about things, dare talk of them as they are, so change can happen. You have to understand the world you live in better than anybody, so you can confront your people with the reality they live in. You have to be ready to empower the new by destroying the old if need be, so the new can come in and bud wonderfully free of the shackles of the past, that was holding it back. You have to be willing to carry that heavy burden. Every mistake will be yours and every success is the country’s. Be the real deal however, and the country will reward you by attributing all its success to you in return, without you asking. Last but not least, always remember that no matter what is happening, what has happened, no matter the hardship, the circumstance, the crimes, he is always by your side and that is your solace and salvation.\n\nMay God bless our new found unity as a United Mauritius",

    "section": "Mythomania Disease",
    "text": "Mythomania Disease\nThere is a disease in the Republic of Mauritius called clout chasing, by the kids of the big name politicians who sadly could not achieve much and so must rely on their good father’s name even though they did not accomplish much too, but unlike them, their legacy is ‘’purer’‘. That is because the illusion that they did ’everything’ is still very much intact and strong. Again your parents would not understand this. Do not even try to convince your parents of these things, given it is bound to be met with resistance. Like the uselessness of race and communalism, this too is something that your parents must come to terms with on their own. You cannot force someone to accept something they cannot understand, yet. You have to have faith in them and give them their space. They will eventually understand it, while some never will. That is the power of indoctrination for you. By design, it is only useful to make someone become more and more closed off about the real nature of things. To be less and less disagreeable. That is why it is a fan favorite among dictatorships in human history. In any way, leave your parents alone and let them enjoy their retirement. You are not going to love your parents less, just because they were brainwashed by shameless politicians now are you? So let god handle it and let’s move on.\nThe first thing we should do is separate the founding fathers of the country and their kids. I have nothing against them. They did not do anything particularly important than any other Mauritian did not do during their lifetime, but they also never let this country turn into the degenerate fuck fest it is today, where everybody is stealing the state’s resources left and right. The old timers, ironically wanted what was best for their country but were simply unequipped, to be able to do anything for their country. They could not afford to be as kind as they had hoped to be. They played their part as best as they could but we need to be honest here. They had no clue what they were doing, besides securing their self-interests at all times. So, naturally, like any father, they gladly stole from the state so that their family’s future, was guaranteed.1 Who would not, with the laws that we had back then? Stealing was free back then. Without any risk. This is what eventually brought the country to its knees, in the 1980’s. Like today, back then, the buck was again passed onto anything that moved. But the cause of the country’s collapse back then was as simple as it is today. Mismanagement of our resources by the politicians and elites of the country. They, of course, got around it just fine by lying back then and today. But in doing that they condemned this country to this future, which it now must deal with. They paved the way for their kids to become the way they are today, a reflection of them. They protected their kids when they committed crimes for which they never served time. They showed their kids, that this country is the one place where they can do whatever they wanted. They stole and stole and stole. All they needed do, to get around it was to lie. People knew no better, education was nowhere to be seen back then. They taught their kids how to disrespect you the people of the Republic of Mauritius and that they have done for 56 years.\nThey looked down on the population of the Republic of Mauritius. You could not live with yourself otherwise. The guilt of lying to the population every day would kill you. Eat you alive. You would kill yourself. You could not lie so much to someone you genuinely cared for. Only someone you looked down on. Someone, you had no respect for. They looked down on you as ‘things’, that exist so they can live good lives, and rationalised their actions. I am sorry to be so honest with you but this is not a choice. If you are incompetent, you simply cannot afford kindness. It is you or them. If you choose them, you oust yourself as an incompetent. No politician has ever done that, because saints and angels only exist in stories. So their kids did the same things as well. Just like most of the world looked at people of the lower class, back in the day. They are not different. They are just human beings. Either they are competent enough to be kind to you or incompetent enough that they are forced to enslave you and look down on you. So that is why, their kids lie so much today. Plenty of proof out there for the curious ones, like the one where a politician that was kicked from the ruling party says that the older people are just a bunch of suckers. The irony is that they destroyed themselves with that one. All of this government’s politicians think of you as suckers. Proof of that is in what the political game has turned into. A bidding war. Offering you money when inflation has been so high but thinking ‘’These suckers would never know, all I have to do is fake the inflation, and they would vote me’’. In other words, in their heads it goes something like this.2\nThis is what the politics of this country has turned into.3 Their actions made you this poor, increased inequality this much and yet they dare act as if they are doing you a favor. Is that all you are worth? A few worthless rupees in 2024. Can’t really blame them though, they cannot afford to do anything else. They do not know anything else. Lying is all they have. Lying is their bread and butter. Lying got them so far. They are naked dumbducks without it. To be honest with you what is happening in Mauritius is surreal. I am not saying, this does not happen everywhere in the world, it does. But the surreal part is the word democracy. This country for some reason is deemed a full democracy when it has no free market, no free competition, no liquid capital markets so that talent can freely emerge, no robust infrastructure for securitization, a pathetic capital market that cannot even link mortgages to treasuries or overnight rates. A country that has only had two prime ministers with a brief special appearance of a third. Democracy? Where buddy? Where? How the fuck did these people get to where they are? How many people did they kill exactly over 56 years? They cannot be kind, they must have killed thousands by now indirectly with all that drug trade. Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware of this? How long will you go on with this charade? For what? A few bank notes here and there? Every day a new family is destroyed so these people can afford to fund their election campaigns. So these people can afford to buy things to gift you to win general elections. Are we supposed to accept the tainted money that kills this country’s children? Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware, that they give tax money willy-nilly to a small group of people because they expect a large cut of it back? Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware that they use public money to do their electoral campaigns? Are we supposed to act as if we give a fuck about them when they give not a fuck about us circa 1968? Are we supposed to let this kind of insolence go unanswered? Where is the respect? Ah right, there is none because they consider you subhumans who exist, so they can lead better lives. Slaves they can exploit. That has been your fate for 56 years now. Want to go 56 more? All you need to do is let their insolence go unanswered or you could finally punish them for 56 years of insolence. You can bully them back by denying them your vote.",

    "text": "Economic Development\nYou should have already deduced this by now if you read the previous article, but The Kingdom of Mauritius has collapsed twice in its history and reached zero growth plenty of times because of an overvalued rupee. The first collapse was in the 1980’s. The second is now. This brings up the obvious question. How the hell did this country ever progress to even come here? The answer is with the beauty of free trade and a lot of luck. Mauritius would have been a lot more developed than it is today had it not been held back by its bad management. You see, back in the day, Europe had a thing for colonies for some reason, and it knew just the way to bolster its relations with newly freed countries. Some free money and some preferential trade agreements to be able to get into the good books of some African countries. Of those, Mauritius belonged to. The Yaounde Convention and The Lome agreement for ACP countries were some of the names of the agreements but that is not the most important part. The most important part is, Mauritius got a preferential trade agreement to sell sugar in the European Common Market which the UK was part of at the time. That allowed it to build a sizeable amount of savings. Unfortunately, we had no real understanding of the world. On the advice of international economists, Mauritius tried to industrialise by increasing tariffs as ‘a way to force’ the local conglomerates to go into manufacturing to do what is called import substitution industrialisation.\nOf course, it was a lost cause, given the domestic demand of the country was a drop of water into the ocean which is world GDP. There was no way to be competitive in anything or export anything because there were obviously no economies of scale. It was just a dumb decision that showcased how bad a hand we had been dealt with in both the public and private sectors. It was kind of wasted money. Because we did not know anything, we had no patents, no knowledge of anything. We still don’t to this day, to be honest. We just import machinery in this country. We do not invent them. It is the only reason we do not have any modern banking infrastructures. Modern open banking infrastructure, where anybody could build applications has to be built. Modern government infrastructure has to be built. You can’t import things like that. Until the US finds a reliable way to simplify it greatly atleast. You have to build your own stuff. The thing is, we can build it today. But the people who can, are not the leaders of the country. Leaders of companies. That is why we need to change things. The people who can do these things are here and dying to help their country. Their country does not want their help though. Their country wants slaves, or imported foreign workers. There are plenty of very competent software engineers in the country. Anyway, we lost a lot of savings in useless import substitution and when you add to that the stealing of resources and the oil shock back then, you get the collapse of the 1980’s.\nSo then how did the Economic Miracle happen? The devil is in the details really. The economic miracle did happen and was a miracle of free trade but most importantly, it was an economic miracle because of what the fate of African countries generally were. It was a miracle because we escaped our pre-determined fate of being branded as a banana republic by the international community. Although, the joke is obviously on us given we are a banana republic today. It was a sarcastic jab in some sense. What happened was in the real world by no means extraordinary but when you placed it in context, what happened took place in Africa. That was the miracle, not what anybody did but rather the fact that an African country had finally been able to leave the trenches of Africa. So to who do we owe this success? To everybody, who worked hard at the time, and that of course includes political leaders but also any ‘labourer’. But the biggest contributor remains external, free trade. You see, sometimes things align by people just following their self-interests and the magic of free trade happens. When import substitution failed, the government backpedaled and decided to turn that project into what became export processing zones or ‘’zone franche’’ if you lived in that time. Psst..everybody did it, it was not a luminary idea, in any sense, everybody, literally every developing country out there has done this. That would have failed too but problems started emerging in international trade in the 1970s, which saved us. Problems that needed solutions. Some countries were exporting excessively in the advanced economies and so the Multi Fiber Arrangement was made to impose quotas and limit exports from developing countries to developed ones. That was a boon for Mauritius, who as a country whose quotas remained unused benefitted tremendously from it. Because it forced a lot of Taiwanese and Hong Kong manufacturers to come here to be able to go above their quotas and continue fulfilling their orders to those developed countries. The local conglomerates copied and learned from them and eventually bought some of their factories, as time passed. So, we indeed got a miracle. An African miracle because we truly did something that was impossible. We progressed against all odds.\n\n\nShow the code\n%%capture\nimport numpy as np\nimport wbgapi as wb\nimport pandas as pd\nimport opinionated\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom cycler import cycler\nfrom opinionated.core import download_googlefont\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter\n\nplt.style.use(\"opinionated_rc\") \ndownload_googlefont('Atkinson Hyperlegible', add_to_cache=True);\nplt.rc('font', family='Atkinson Hyperlegible')\n\ndef reformat(a,b):\n  if a &gt; 1000 or -1000:\n    val = round(a/1000,1)\n    new_tick = '${:.0f}K'.format(val)\n    \n  return new_tick\n\ndollar = FuncFormatter(reformat)\n\nplt.rc('axes', prop_cycle=(cycler('color', list(['#00308F','#007FFF','#6F00FF','#4C516D'])) *\n                           cycler('linestyle', ['-', '--', ':', '-.'])))\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndf = wb.data.DataFrame('NY.GDP.PCAP.KD',['MUS',\"SSF\",\"SGP\",\"USA\",\"WLD\",\"CHN\",\"IND\",\"KOR\",\"HKG\"],\ntime=range(1960, 2024, 1), labels=True,numericTimeKeys=True)\n\n\ndf.set_index('Country', inplace=True)\n\ndf = df.T\n\n#df.plot(figsize=(8.75,4),fontsize=13)\n#plt.yscale('log')\n#plt.ylim(0,100000)\n#plt.ylabel('Output per worker (Constant 2015 $)',fontsize=13)\n#plt.xlabel('Date',fontsize=20)\n#plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.35,0.5),fontsize=13)\n#plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(dollar)\n#plt.title('The convergence of different countries', x=1.32, fontsize=20,ha='right',fontweight='bold')\npd.concat([df.head(10), df.tail(10)]).map(\"${:,.0f}\".format)\n\n#plt.savefig('../posts/images/convergence.svg',bbox_inches='tight')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nHong Kong SAR, China\nKorea, Rep.\nIndia\nChina\nWorld\nUnited States\nSingapore\nSub-Saharan Africa\nMauritius\n\n\n\n\n1960\n$nan\n$1,028\n$306\n$238\n$3,650\n$18,992\n$3,612\n$1,139\n$1,414\n\n\n1961\n$3,956\n$1,067\n$310\n$175\n$3,744\n$19,109\n$3,777\n$1,124\n$1,726\n\n\n1962\n$4,334\n$1,077\n$312\n$164\n$3,875\n$19,965\n$3,952\n$1,163\n$1,692\n\n\n1963\n$4,847\n$1,142\n$323\n$176\n$3,985\n$20,546\n$4,240\n$1,206\n$1,877\n\n\n1964\n$5,140\n$1,218\n$339\n$204\n$4,160\n$21,438\n$4,004\n$1,235\n$1,706\n\n\n1965\n$5,740\n$1,274\n$323\n$233\n$4,303\n$22,526\n$4,215\n$1,260\n$1,722\n\n\n1966\n$5,791\n$1,392\n$316\n$250\n$4,443\n$23,715\n$4,530\n$1,253\n$1,626\n\n\n1967\n$5,737\n$1,483\n$333\n$230\n$4,516\n$24,045\n$4,985\n$1,212\n$1,665\n\n\n1968\n$5,807\n$1,640\n$337\n$215\n$4,687\n$24,948\n$5,562\n$1,218\n$1,522\n\n\n1969\n$6,364\n$1,836\n$351\n$244\n$4,865\n$25,472\n$6,237\n$1,293\n$1,570\n\n\n2014\n$41,797\n$28,100\n$1,490\n$7,533\n$9,987\n$55,818\n$54,682\n$1,652\n$9,182\n\n\n2015\n$42,432\n$28,737\n$1,590\n$8,016\n$10,178\n$57,040\n$55,646\n$1,654\n$9,508\n\n\n2016\n$43,088\n$29,467\n$1,701\n$8,517\n$10,344\n$57,659\n$56,899\n$1,630\n$9,868\n\n\n2017\n$44,381\n$30,313\n$1,796\n$9,053\n$10,580\n$58,703\n$59,415\n$1,627\n$10,248\n\n\n2018\n$45,280\n$31,059\n$1,891\n$9,619\n$10,808\n$60,127\n$61,216\n$1,629\n$10,652\n\n\n2019\n$44,195\n$31,646\n$1,944\n$10,156\n$10,977\n$61,331\n$61,334\n$1,628\n$10,957\n\n\n2020\n$41,451\n$31,378\n$1,815\n$10,358\n$10,548\n$59,395\n$59,144\n$1,555\n$9,363\n\n\n2021\n$44,531\n$32,771\n$1,975\n$11,223\n$11,112\n$62,741\n$67,639\n$1,580\n$9,679\n\n\n2022\n$43,283\n$33,690\n$2,098\n$11,560\n$11,365\n$63,721\n$67,949\n$1,598\n$10,570\n\n\n2023\n$43,548\n$34,121\n$2,239\n$12,174\n$11,567\n$65,020\n$65,422\n$1,604\n$11,319\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\quad\\]\n\n\n\nWhen you look at the table or the log scaled graph you can clearly see, that we were really struggling to have consistent growth from the 60’s-80’s because sugarcane like any crop is dependent on weather conditions. A good year would push GDP up only for it to contract and go down again the next because of bad weather conditions. Textiles, on the other hand, were consistent. The world’s population was rising, they needed to be clothed and so we got a free ticket from fulfilling that need that allowed us to get out of the trenches of poverty that plagued Sub-Saharian Africa back then and still does to this day. But this is where all our problems ironically start as well. You see, we have not done anything since the 1980s besides import all the capital we can afford. We have imported a lot of capital, and transitioned to a services economy which was a bad thing to do given that is what made us converge to zero growth. We decreased our long-term productive capacity slowly for short-term profits which pushed us to zero growth in 2019. It is good to say this bluntly. Our country, de-industrialised without having ever really been fully industrialised first. Why? Because we do not know shit. You can only do shit you know. Like exploit elsewhere where labor is cheaper for labor-intensive manufacturing in India. That we do excessively well. What about here though? All we excelled at was importing capital. Be a jack of all trades. Good at nothing but present everywhere. The defining characteristic of a dumbduck some might say.",

    "text": "A world wide increase in living standards\nNow why is it then, that no political party or even the private sector, has been able to reproduce another economic miracle in the Republic of Mauritius after the one that happened in the 1980’s? Why is it that no one knew what the ingredients to that initial success were so that they could once again cook another miracle? Do you seriously never ask yourself that question? What did we have then that we do not have now? I already told you the answer. The answer is free trade. An ingredient that is out of our control because we did not do anything to make it happen. Globalisation happened, and the domination of free trade changed the world without anybody needing to be more competent. America, Europe and Asia brought their competence forward and carried the world, by gifting them their labor-intensive manufacturing operations by giving them their equipment, as capital that they could import as they now moved to the capital-intensive electronics age we live in. It is hard to fathom the value chains that free trade coupled with network systems (the internet), and computers have made possible. It is crazy, how much living standards have improved because of it. Just like they did in the industrial revolution by increasing living standards by its biggest amount ever to give people worldwide basic plumbing through trade as long as they could afford it.\nAll of these, are things that you do not need to go invent today. All that is required of you is your cooperation for you to use these ready-made things or technologies for most of the things you do. You call that importable free technology. Even the materials for basic toilet plumbing are free importable technology. Technology that is freely importable is no longer considered technology however for the rest of the world that imports it. It is just capital. They rarely know anything about it. They will employ people who know how to use the capital but rarely will they know how to build it from scratch. It must be said that this is a phase every country must go through to sort itself out. Technology really allowed competence to bloom in most advanced economies where free markets existed. Most of the people at any of the Fortune 500 companies today have nothing in common with their counterparts who led those companies post World War two. Most did not even exist back then. You must truly understand this current era we live in, is the most competitive the world has ever been. Especially among the top 500 companies in the world but not only. Globalisation changes business and even academia. Everything became more competitive, music, comedy, TV, sports. To be at that level means that in your own way, you can connect many fields of study. That is your value, you are not the smartest in any room. You can nevertheless enter almost any room and follow the conversations that are going on in them. That is what it takes to be a leader of a Fortune 500 company today. To be the Swiss army knife.\nThe Republic of Mauritius imports capital. It has none of that. It is not me being offensive. It is the truth. It cannot have it. We are a country that is not on any frontier of technology and science. We are a freeloader of the world by excellence. We do not do any serious research on anything. We have zero patents after 56 years. That is why there is no free market, no vision, nothing here. It is an empty island, we all live in with a lot of talk. Empty nevertheless is all the talk. The past 56 years prove it enough. All we do is one thing. We just import capital and use the technology that is handed to us on a platter. Can barely fucking invent anything. In all sectors of the economy. We are collectors of companies but not good at anything in particular except perhaps giving our government a good wank to keep the flow of public money steady. There is so little competition in this country that some conglomerates own banks for some reason. There has never been a single landmark antitrust case or legislation. That is why the majority of our increases in real output come from that solely. The accumulation of that free technology and the productivity that comes along from using that capital. Look, the truth is, if our country had just one firm that did wealth management, that was better than any firm in the world, trillions of dollars would come rushing into the country, leaving New York, Beijing, Tokyo, Paris, and London. That is the power of competence. I’m being real with you. The almighty dollar is enamored with competence. Of being able to do something better than others. Money circulates to where the competence can be found in abundance because that is where the money can also be more efficiently used to generate more money.\nDo you understand that? The almighty dollar does not care about consent. Where competence is high, it will go in flocks. But wait? It does come in Mauritius too in the global business sector? Why? What do we have here in Mauritius exactly? Does money come in for the competence in the global business sector? A lot of companies come here, because of the possibility of setting up modern sweat-shops here for labour intensive cheap back office accounting, human resources administration services and software development services etc… Our countries suck at giving out fair wages. Foreign companies love it, they get to keep their bills smaller. Mostly though, in the case of global businesses, they come here because of the conveniences it provides them which hugely outweighs the costs, when it concerns setting companies to route investments to other places in the world. Because of the rule of law that is non-existent, so that anybody can launder as much money as they want with properties and some other flimsy tricks via the global business sector. Giving companies the ability to evade taxes. That is not competence, that is a technicality. Technicalities are never permanent. They are loopholes engineered by powerful people wishing to evade taxes, temporarily. The dollar that comes in flocks to our country only comes in flocks to pass through it to go somewhere else, and to benefit from DTAA’s. The biggest flow that is to India’s capital market is now dwindling as of 2024. So this very thing which has been holding Mauritius for the past ten years along with the sale of real estate to foreigners is bound to be the very thing that will be our undoing if capital flight happens.",

    "text": "Economic growth in the long run\nSo the people in control of this country are just as much headless chickens as the ones in the private sector. That is the biggest problem of the Republic of Mauritius. It would do you good to remember this, if competence does not exist, honest opinions cannot exist. Morality cannot exist. I cannot give a fuck about you if giving a fuck about you would mean, I lose my privileged place in society. That is just the blunt truth. I cannot give a fuck about you, if I all can do is kill your children to earn money by engaging in the drug trade. I cannot give my honest opinion if giving my honest opinion of things would mean the government would close its tap of public money to me, which would open me to the most dreaded of possibilities, bankruptcy. The private sector does not really care about who comes into power. It only cares about its interest. So it cannot give a single fuck about you. This makes politics pointless in the Republic of Mauritius. Because powerful people in the private sector are simply not equipped to give a fuck. They will all make generous contributions to all parties and do their best to stay in the good books of any government for their own self interests. Because there is zero competition, in the end, it’s all useless. It could only harm them to engage in any way. They already have everything. A golden spoon, in the way laws are made for them. I am not saying the private sector does not care. Maybe they do but they are not allowed to care. Because they cannot go at it alone.\nI don’t really blame the conglomerates, to be honest. They are not politicians. None of them ever came on camera every week and pretended to give a fuck about you all. I am not even mad at the conglomerates for not potentially caring about the general population because it is basic human nature and nothing to frown upon. That is not their responsibility. I am only mad that dumb people stand at the top of the country. But your well-being and my well-being are not on them in the end. You should always expect them to be looking to earn the maximum amount they can, even the most competent person out there. As a government, if you want morality to exist, you need to have laws that enable a lot of competition. Who would refuse to be given a monopoly in a market so they can get free money and be fed from a literal golden spoon.4 I guess this just goes to show that not a single fuck has been given to you by all government for 56 years. Facts are facts, even sad facts. Alright, this should be a good enough amount of destruction, of the made-up narratives that were cooked up by politicians as to what this country went through for 56 years. I told you the objective truth. Whether you believe it or not, is up to you and not up to me. I have given you the choice that was robbed from you for 56 years. Nevertheless that choice remains your call to make, not mine. Let’s get serious now, and focus on understanding economic growth. Modern Economic growth is all Robert Solow and to a lesser degree Trevor Swan who both invented the Exogenous Growth Model after world war 2. Switch gears, it is going to get mathematical now.\nJust like price, in our last paper, output is not easy to estimate because there are so many different markets in a country, and yet, we can simplify things to make it easier to try to understand the behavior of output in the long run in any economy. The output you generally see that is reported in the news every quarter is estimated very laboriously just like price is. This is why like inflation, output can be easily manipulated by playing with numbers. Mostly just modifying the GDP deflator will do the trick but sometimes you can be cheeky and boost production numbers too. The Republic of Mauritius has done both since 2014. From 2014 to 2019, government boosted production numbers. Since 2020, government has been boosting production numbers, and underreporting the GDP deflator. The methodology used to estimate output every quarter is owed to Wassily Leontief for his invention of the input-output model. Leontief was Solow’s doctoral advisor. Basically, he suggested using linear algebra as a way to calculate the total output of a country. A friendly introduction to that if you want to learn it can be found here and is easy to digest.\nThe beauty of the exogenous growth model comes from being able to abstract all of this away by using assumptions that simplify the construction of the model. The model assumes that there is only one capital good that is produced, accumulated, and undergoes depreciation. There is perpetual full employment. That greatly simplifies things in that we can simply use an aggregate production to construct the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Assumption\n\n\n\nReal GDP \\(Y(t)\\) is determined by a production function using these two factors we just talked about. The one capital good and a predetermined amount of labor of which all are always employed i.e there is perpetual full employment. \\(Y=F(K,L)\\). One production function which can accomodate these assumptions is the Cobb-Douglas production function where.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\nY(t)= K^{\\alpha}(t)(A(t)L(t))^{1-\\alpha}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nLet’s go through each of the pieces of this.\n\n\\(K(t)\\) is the total stock of capital in the economy at time \\(t\\). This combines the values of all structures, equipment, and intellectual property used by all the establishments. More capital, more real GDP.\n\\(L(t)\\) is the total amount of labor in the economy at time \\(t\\). This could be a count of the number of workers, or we can get fancy and think of it as a combined stock of skills and abilities that those workers bring with them. Either way, more labor, more real GDP.\n\\(A(t)\\) is the level of productivity at time \\(t\\). It measures how efficiently we use the capital and labor in the economy. Higher productivity, higher real GDP. This is what we simply do not have in Mauritius just FYI.\n\nLet us also look at why the Cobb-Douglas is the most common and popular choice among production functions. It is because it can handily respect the following important conditions.\n\nThe first is CRS (Constant Returns to scale) which just means that a doubling of inputs will double output. Doubling capital and labor in mauritius will automatically double the output we produce. That is what it means.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{2}\nA(cK)^{\\alpha}(cL)^{1-\\alpha} = (c^{\\alpha} c^{1-\\alpha})Y = cY\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nThe second is the first and second derivative of output Y with respects to K or the Marginal Product of Capital (MPK). The cobb-douglas production function entails decreasing marginal returns to capital accumulation. This turns out to be the key element of the model. What does this mean in layman terms? If a firm acquires an extra unit of capital, it should raise its output. But if the firm keeps piling on extra capital without raising the number of workers available to use this capital, the increases in output will probably taper off. In the Cobb-Douglas case, the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) dictates the pace of this tapering off.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{3}\nY_{K} &gt; 0 \\quad Y_{KK} &lt; 0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe basics of the solow model are the following equations.\n\nCapital accumulates according to\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{4}\n\\dot{K}(t) = Y(t) - C(t) - \\delta K(t) \\\\\n= S(t) - \\delta K(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn other words, the addition to the capital stock each period depends positively on savings (this is a closed-economy model so savings equals investment) and negatively on depreciation, which is assumed to take place at rate \\(\\delta\\). In simple words, more savings equal a higher upper bound for our final capital stock and a higher depreciation will set a lower upper bound (supremum) for our final capital stock by making the cost of maintenance of capital higher.\n\nLabour input grows at rate n meaning\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{5}\n\n\\dot{L} = nL \\quad L(t) = L_{0}\\exp(nt)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nLabour Efficiency or Productivity grows at rate g meaning\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{6}\n\n\\dot{A} = gA \\quad A(t) = A_{0}\\exp(gt)\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nA fraction of output is saved each period which is also total investment.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{7}\nY(t)-C(t)= sY(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nMost elementary analysis of the solow model will be focused on understanding the steady state. I will cover this so that you may test your understanding of what I have discussed with you so far. Suppose I solved the solow model for the following production function.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{8}\nY(t)=K^{0.5}(t)(AL^{0.5}(t))\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhat do we do know ? How do we proceed ? We could start by acknowledging (7) as the net increase in capital stock for every period or \\(\\dot{K}\\). Note that, I will leave out the time notation hereon because of tediousness involved in writing them all the time. So we get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{9}\n\\dot{K} = sY\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow we can insert (8) back in (9) to get (10)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{10}\n\\dot{K} = s(K^{0.5},(AL^{0.5}))\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow we could divide (8) with a factor \\(c=\\frac{1}{AL}\\) to get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{11}\n\\frac{Y}{AL} = F(\\frac{K}{AL},1)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe could now define \\(y = \\frac{Y}{AL}\\) as output per effective worker and \\(k=\\frac{K}{AL}\\) as capital per effective worker giving us \\(y=f(k,1)\\). We would thus end up with the fundamental differential equation called the law of motion of capital by inserting (4), (5), (6), and (11) in (10) giving us\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{12}\n\\dot{k} = sy - (g + n + \\delta)k \\\\\n= sf(k)^{0.5} - (g+n+\\delta)k\n\\end{equation}\\]\nGraphically or geometrically, we say that the change in \\(k\\) is given by the difference of \\(sy\\) and \\((g+n+\\delta)k\\). As long as \\(sy &gt; (g+n+\\delta)k\\) then \\(k\\) will increase. On the other hand as long as \\(sy &lt; (g+n+\\delta)k\\), \\(k\\) will decrease. When \\(sy = (g+n+\\delta)k\\), that is where a steady state is reached and \\(\\dot{k}=0\\) or the change in k is zero. In fact, by integrating (12) and saving on notation we get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{13}\nk(t) = [k_{0}^b +(\\frac{s}{d})\\exp(-bdt)-(\\frac{s}{d})]^{\\frac{1}{b}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(b=1-\\alpha\\) and \\(d=g+n+\\delta\\) and \\(k_{0}\\) is the initial capital stock we start with. It can be seen that as \\(t\\) gets larger and larger, \\(k(t)\\) grows according to \\((\\frac{s}{d})^{\\frac{1}{b}}\\). This can be verified by setting \\(\\dot{k}=0\\) in (12). Which gives us the steady state \\(k^{*}\\).\n\\[0 = s(k^{*})^{0.5}-(g+n+\\delta)k^{*} = k^{*} = (\\frac{s}{n+g+\\delta})^\\frac{1}{1-0.5} \\]\nLikewise in steady state output grows at rate \\(n+g\\) i.e at the rate that \\(AL\\) grows that is population growth and labor productivity while output per worker grows at rate \\(g\\). We call that the balanced growth path because this is basically a constant growth rate when \\(k^{*}\\) (the steady state is reached).\n\\[ y^{*} = (\\frac{s}{n+g+\\delta})^{\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}} \\]\nYou can derive it fairly easily by defining some notation for the economical handling of a growth series by using logs. Using the definition below and using the two following properties of logarithms.\n\\[\\frac{d(\\log Y)}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\log Y)}{dY}\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{Y}}{Y} = G^{Y}\\]\n\\[\\log(X \\cdot Y)= \\log X + \\log Y \\] \\[\\log(X^{Y}) = Y\\log X \\]\nWe modify (8) to get\n\\[ G^{Y} = G^{A} + \\alpha G^{K} + (1-\\alpha) G^{L} \\]\nSetting \\(G^{A}=g\\) and \\(G^{L}=n\\) and \\(\\alpha=0.5\\) we then get\n\\[ G^{Y} = g + 0.5 G^{K} + 0.05 n \\]\nThis means all variations in the growth rate of output are due to variations in the growth rate for capital. If output is growing at a constant rate, then capital must also be growing at a constant rate. And we know that the capital-output ratio tends to move towards a specific equilibrium value. So along a steady growth path, the growth rate of output equals the growth rate of capital. Thus, the previous equation can be re-written as\n\\[ G^{Y} = g + 0.5 G^{Y} + 0.05 + n \\]\nSubstracting \\(0.5 G^{Y}\\) from both sides we get the growth rate of output\n\\[ G^{Y} = \\frac{g}{0.5} + n \\]\nSubstracting \\(n\\) from both sides we get the rate of growth of output per worker\n\\[ G^{Y} - n = \\frac{g}{0.5} \\]\nSo output per effective worker depends negatively on population growth, and capital’s share of total income. It depends positively on \\(g\\) called labor productivity. Now, we will come back to the implications of this a bit further down. For now, lets refocus on the steady state. People like to say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Let’s graph what this all means, in practice. Now, I will explain the graphs to you but, if you understood what has been discussed so far, you should generally have an inkling of the explanations before I give them to you. Because the solow model is elegant and intuitive. So, if you can guess as the explanations. That’s a good sign that you have understood everything so far.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ng, n, s, alpha, delta = 0.02 , 0.02, 1, 0.5, 0.03\nx0 = 0.25\nxmin, xmax = 0, 2\n\ndef graph(g, n, s, alpha, delta, k):\n    return  s * k**alpha - (n+g+delta) * k\n\ndef plot45():\n    xgrid = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 12000)\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n    ax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax)\n\n    graph_values = graph(g, n, s, alpha, delta, xgrid)\n\n    ymin, ymax = np.min(graph_values), np.max(graph_values)\n    ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)\n\n    lb = r'$\\dot{k}_{t} = sk^{\\alpha} - (n+g+\\delta)k$'\n    ax.plot(xgrid, graph_values,  lw=2, alpha=0.6, label=lb)\n    ax.plot(xgrid, xgrid, 'k-', lw=1, alpha=0.7, label='$45^{\\circ}$')\n\n    ax.legend(loc='upper left', frameon=False, fontsize=12)\n\n    circle_rad = 30\n    ax.set_xticks((0, 1, 2))\n    ax.set_yticks((0, 1, 2))\n    ax.annotate(r'$\\dot{k}^{*}_{t} = (\\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta })^{(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha})}$',\n     xy=(0.873, 0.873), xytext=(0.3, 1), arrowprops=dict(\n                arrowstyle='simple,tail_width=0.3,head_width=0.8,head_length=0.8',\n                facecolor='b', shrinkB=circle_rad * 1.2),fontsize=15)\n    ax.set_xlabel('$k_t$', fontsize=12)\n    ax.set_ylabel('$k_{t+1}$', fontsize=12)\n\n    plt.show()\n\n\nplot45()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo \\(k^{*}\\) is the steady state which means what ? At that point total investment and total depreciation are equal so the net change in \\(k\\) is zero. On the flipside if we start at the right most side of the graph where \\(k_0=2\\) what will happen ? Total depreciation will be more than total investment which will force \\(k\\) down to \\(k^{*}\\). If we start at the left most side of the graph where we can set the intial value \\(k_0=0.1\\) what will happen ? Total depreciation will be less than total investment which will push \\(k\\) up to \\(k^{*}\\) the steady state. Easy enough ? Differential equations that have steady states are fairly simple to comprehend. Depending on the initial value of \\(k_0\\) that you will choose, the system will either move up to \\(k^{*}\\) or be forced down to \\(k^{*}\\). Let us visualise this with another graph to make sure you get it. The solow model, is all about the steady state. All economies in the world have different ‘steady states’ which they are converging to at all times.\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.rc('axes', prop_cycle=(cycler('color', list(['#00308F','#007FFF','#6F00FF','#4C516D'])) +\n                           cycler('linestyle', ['-', '--', ':', '-.'])))\n\n# Yes this is a different production function but the graph is what matters here, I did it correctly  for the first graph and it is a pain to get right.

Do you see how the curve is changing as it is getting closer to the steady state? All the \\(k_0\\) starts as a curve and finishes when it reaches the steady state as a flat line. Why ? You should be able to answer that. If you cannot find the answer, then do not move on just yet. Do what I suggest next and ensure you understand before moving on. Watch this and this and always remember that youtube is your friend ! For those that can understand this, let us look at the continuous version of this same process.\n\n\nShow the code\nA, s, alpha, delta = 2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4\n\n# Yes this is a different production function but the graph is what matters here, I did it correctly for the first graph and it is a pain to get right.

In the solow model the slope of capital at any time is called the Marginal Product of Capital and is abbreviated MPK \\(\\frac{\\partial{F(K,L)}}{\\partial{K}}\\). Similarly we have the Marginal Product of Labor and it is abbreviated MPL \\(\\frac{\\partial{F(K,L)}}{\\partial{L}}\\).\n\\[ MPK = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Capital}}\\] \\[ MPL = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Labor}} \\]\nMeaning how much does output change from a given change in capital. In the cobb douglas production function, as you can see from the graph when the first unit of capital is added the MPK is infinite because of the vertical asymptote. When the last unit of capital is added the MPK is zero. Mathematically we write them as limit conditions.\n\\[\\lim_{k \\to 0} f'(k) = \\infty \\] \\[\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f'(k) = 0 \\]\nTo make things even simpler to understand, let us apply it to an example. If we use our example production (8). We can find its MPK and MPL.\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial{F(K,L)}}{\\partial{K}} = 0.5K^{0.5-1}L^{1-0.5} \\]\nWe can re-arrange this by removing the factor \\(K^{-1}\\) out giving us the MPK in a cobb-douglas production function as \\(0.5YK^{-1}\\) or \\(0.5\\frac{Y}{K}\\). The same process can be done for the MPL. Just remember that you only differentiate partially here and leave the rest fixed. We did not touch L. Do the MPL on your own as an exercise using the power rule. Then let us show, how capital accumulation which is what we did here in Mauritius for 56 years can only provide you with growth that fades with time as the MPK goes down. Let us do a simple tabular example. You should do the middle ones on your own. But as you can see in the end this is where we are in our country. Capital does not really do much of anything anymore. We already have a lot of it.\n\n\nThe MPK in any economy given enough time will decrease.\n\n\nTime\nTotal Output\nTotal K\nMPK\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n100\n500\n\\(\\frac{dY}{dK}=0.05\\frac{100}{500}=0.1\\)\n\n\n5\n175\n1000\n\\(0.5\\frac{175}{1000}=0.0875\\)\n\n\n8\n325\n1500\n\\(0.5\\frac{325}{1500}=0.108\\)\n\n\n15\n500\n2000\n-\n\n\n20\n550\n2500\n-\n\n\n35\n635\n4500\n\\(0.5\\frac{635}{4500}=0.0705\\)\n\n\n38\n645\n5000\n\\(0.5\\frac{645}{5000}=0.0645\\)\n\n\n40\n650\n5500\n\\(0.5\\frac{650}{5500}=0.06\\)\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have left price out but we may now bring price in now by going from real to nominal prices and understanding how the MPK (Real Return on Capital) and the MPL (Real Wages) relates to them in the following fashion.\n\\[ Y\\cdot P = WL + RK \\]\nWhere P is prices, W is nominal wages, and R is the Real Return on Capital. Dividing them by \\(P\\) we get\n\\[ Y = (\\frac{W}{P})L + (\\frac{R}{P})K = (MPL)L + (MPK)K = wL + rK \\]\nWe can now show that the real wage grows at the rate of technological progress or increases in labor productivity/efficiency \\(g\\). Define and set w equal to total labor income divided by labor income and transform the equation into a growth series and then re-arrange accordingly into the fact that labor income grows at rate \\(g\\) in steady state.\n\\[ TLI = \\text{Total Labor Income} \\] \\[ L =\\text{Labor Income}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nw = \\frac{TLI}{L}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[ G^{w} = \\frac{G^{TLI}}{G^{L}} \\]\n\\[g = \\frac{G^{TLI}}{n}\\]\nQuite literally if we hold n to be a constant and set \\(n=1\\), then all growth in total labor income comes solely from \\(g\\). Equivalently, if we hold the growth rate of \\(n\\) to be big enough, g becomes smaller and smaller so it may be equally shared among the labor force \\(L\\) earning \\(TLI\\). No need to panic though if \\(G^{TLI}&gt;G^{L}\\), then \\(g\\) will be be allowed to grow just fine as it is the case in most advanced economies. What do you think has been happening in Mauritius if we take inflation to be around 90% for the period 2020 to 2024. Real wages has been decreasing, and total capital income would have been increasing a lot. So \\(G^{w}&lt;G^{TLI}\\). If real wages are increasing over time it must be true that \\(G^{w}&gt;G^{TLI}\\). That is how labor can increase their real share of national income over time.\nIn the United States at one point that made \\(TLI^{US}=\\frac{2}{3}Y\\). It has since gone down, because real wages have not kept up with total labor income increases in the last 30 years, which has brought TLI to \\(TLI^{US}=[0.60,0.66]Y\\). Locally in Mauritius, the same has been true for the last 56 years. \\(TKI^{MU}=[0.52,0.55]Y\\), Total Capital Income has been steady at around 52-55%. Equality? There has been never been much of that, gini indexes are fairly useless. Median real income is what matters and it has been steady. How do I know? Because the share of income has stayed the same. Worse it has decreased in the past four years. Inequality has been more or less the same for the last 56 years and in the last four years it has increased dramatically although to say how much is impossible without reliable data. So, that is where, all the record profits being recorded by almost all big companies, come from (They are not real, they are nominal illusions).\nAdditionally, we can already see what effect the import of foreign labor who will do non skilled work will have on your real wages ? It will decrease them, force them down, literally by forcing you to share the total labor income with them that is already much smaller. At best \\(TLI=0.4Y\\) is currently in Mauritius. I have nothing against these people, but that total labor income is already much smaller because of the 90% inflation. Importing foreign labour into our country now would signal the permanent social death of a large of our working population. We can do the same thing for capital by defining the real rate of return on capital to be equal the MPK. Note that there is no need for growth rates here because we are interested in \\(r_{t}\\) alone. We already covered how the MPK works. Go back and review it if you need to.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{14}\nr_{t}  = \\alpha \\frac{Y}{K}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe real return on capital in Mauritius is low. We have already accumulated a lot of capital in the last 30 years. Infact, we might argue that the MPK should have a short term iteration to it, to be able to explain why capital does not come into our country lately. I can attest to it, you can attest to it, the whole country can attest to it. There is a huge FCY shortage. Capital from this country own’s conglomerates stopped flowing into it. They are flowing into US treasuries which is the wise choice if they know of this country’s true position. Of course they do. So, when you factor in real interest rates which should be a solid alternative to the MPK to explain this behavior, it becomes obvious that the elites know how high inflation truly is because of their decisions. It seems obvious to say this but investing in Mauritius is not a very rationally sound thing to do lately. Because the country has been deleveraging hard and this has made real interest rates wildly negative, which is why this country’s elite has most likely already and completely jumped ship into dollars. It is only you and me, the paupers of this land. The slaves, that must be forced to keep our useless currency. So, the real interest rate is calculated as expected inflation minus actual inflation. In the last four years, it has been hugely negative to deleverage our country with inflation.\n\\[ \\pi^{R}_{t} = \\pi^{E}_{t} - \\pi^{A}_{t} \\]\nNow, you might ask, what is expected inflation? What is a good definition of it? It is what people expect inflation to be this year, and so will make their best effort by their actions, to hedge against it. The expected inflation is what they will try to offset when negotiating cost of living adjustments every year. In mauritius we call that “Compensation Salariale”. You can see that it has increased in Mauritius from 2020 to 2024 meaning it indicates a consistent increase in expected inflation \\(\\pi^{E}_{t}\\) from 2020 to 2024.\n\n\nTHIS TABLE ALONE SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU THAT INFLATION IS ONLY GOING UP UP UP.\n\n\nYear\nCost of Living Adjustment\n\n\n\n\n2020\n200 Rupees\n\n\n2021\n375 Rupees\n\n\n2022\n500 Rupees\n\n\n2023\n1000 Rupees\n\n\n2024\n1500-2000 Rupees\n\n\n\n\nThis table should inform you that everybody is expecting inflation to be higher with each passing year and that \\(\\pi^{E}_{2024}\\) is higher than last year. This is why the conglomerates have been short on the rupee by holding their dollars, which is a much smarter choice. It is just a good decision to get out of the rupee because it is a currency that has had 90% inflation in the past four years. So conglomerates have been making record profits only nominally given our country is collapsing. Think about it, has the Government of Mauritius ever restricted the buying and selling of foreign currency like this ever before? They used all kinds of excuses like covid, war, and no tourism. There is more than a dictatorship in the management of foreign currency in Mauritius. Still, you seriously think, they did not get out of the rupee? It is free money for them given they depreciate the currency when they want to because they have total control of the central bank. What is happening with the management of the national currency of this country is downright criminal these days.\nNow let’s move on from the steady state, you see in practice countries rarely finish capital accumulation. Watch this if this seems odd to you. If they finish it they are in trouble, like our country is in because almost always in practice if you finish it you jump to the right side of the steady state where you are not forming enough capital to replace all the depreciated ones. You see this in plenty of countries today. In Mauritius, you can see it everywhere. Delo 24/7 is still a pipe dream (see what I did there :D). Public hospitals are close to complete ruin. Most government buildings are ruined. Safe city cameras will never be replaced, because it costs way too much to replace. Electronic capital stock depreciates quickly and requires that you are quite a rich country to be able to maintain it. We are not. We are poor. So today, we have to make ridiculous choices. Choose which capital stock to replace. Choose which projects are more important to be able to win an election. Build some cheap houses that will almost certainly depreciate as quickly as the new Supreme Court building. Know why? Because we POOR buddy. P O O R. We can either build one hundred good houses that will last one hundred years, or build a thousand that will last five years. Guess which choice we went with?\nThe reason why countries do not finish accumulating capital stems from the fact that in steady state output continues to grow at a constant rate \\(n+g\\) called a balanced growth path. This means new real savings in (7) or (9) are always “minted” so more capital may be accumulated with time. In essence, as we discussed in Macroeconomic Laws 1, in monetary terms this is the SI unit of productivity. In a macroeconomic system, there is no other way to look at it, strictly or rigorously. We have real consumption and real savings. Any increase in real output is met with SI unit inflation and productivity through consumption and savings. As more and more productivity is had (more real savings are created), that has the effect of pushing prices down or inflation down because we are differing consumption to a later date. We are not cheating anything. It is a simple system where inflation is guided by the amount of real savings it has at its disposal and the rate at which the system is burning through that real savings with nominal consumption. When these real savings are burned at a faster rate than they get created because of nominal increases of money in the goods and services market (consumption), inflation responds in kind by increasing more and more, and the real savings are burned through quicker.\nFor example most rapid increases in prices from heavy industrialisation in the tradables sector5, comes from exchange rate movements and in the form of non-tradables having to match wage increases, moving the RER. Not inflation, but productivity divided partly between exchange rate \\(k\\) adjustment and real wage \\(w\\) adjustment. Human inaction will cause more exchange rate adjustments. Human action to burn the real savings by increasing \\(w\\) will make less of it fall on the exchange rate. Fixed exchange rates will cause real wages \\(w\\) to bear the brunt of the adjustment. All of these determine the RER which is impossible to measure accurately because it relies on price indexes as discussed in Macroeconmic Laws 1.\nIn that sense, Paul Krugman in his wonderful essay of The Myth of the Asian Miracle is somewhat wrong although he is paradoxally at the same time also right. He gives a lot of importance to efficiency growth or what we call productivity but chooses to look at it as something external to the system basically as a literal \\(A\\) that exists. As if, more real savings (more investment) is not automatically the result of the labor productivity increasing. But rather that labor productivity is something different. That productivity in and of itself exists to an economic system as the literal \\(A\\) . It does not. There is just consumption and savings. Of course, it is a mere detail, and many at the time, the best of the best thought like Krugman, like for example Alywn Young6. Plenty in fact, had different takes on this at the time.7 On why East Asia and the Pacific had been able to converge to join the rich countries club which they are still a part of today. Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, even China has come a long way.\nThis is why, we must understand this phenomenon that the solow model predicts which is called conditional convergence. We must also explain why it failed, for example, why did it fail in Mauritius. The best paper on the matter by Mankiw, Romer and Weil yielded what is called the augmented solow model that adds human capital to it. That paper’s argumentation is ruined by a case like ours. Education has been fine in Mauritius, not extraordinary, not Singapore-like, standard-wise, but it has been decent. Yet, look where we are with our country. That is because the human capital that we possess is not used efficiently at all. The dumbducks are holding us back. They are not as smart as they pretend to be given they failed in Industrialising our country when they had the complete reigns of it for 56 years now. There are also a lot of oil countries out there, that would not necessarily respect this augmented narrative. They nevertheless respect something much more simple. The generation of consistently more and more savings each period, to be able to have more and more capital formation over a long period of time. If we wish to explain why we failed to converge or why any country fails to converge thus, we must have the honesty to flat-out say it. Its corruption plus incompetence.\nMeaning, that the reason why countries do not converge is that they allocate their resources so inefficiently, that eventually they stop creating new savings, and must then tap into already existing savings. Corruption plus incompetence is a global phenomenon. Thus, depending on just how much fresh savings you are able to generate, it might be less and less obvious. America is just as corrupt as Africa and so is Norway, Sweden, New Zealand, and Singapore. Indeed, rather than get into a debate about corruption plus incompetence, let’s just be blunt and say it, it is all about the capital-output ratio and your output per worker level. The lower it is the bigger the problem of corruption plus incompetence will be, because the shocks you get on savings then are truly detrimental to the development of an economy. As you get to a higher and higher capital-output ratio, however, there just comes a point where corruption plus incompetence is totally inconsequential for the economy. There is just too much savings being generated by the existing capital stock combined with labor productivity. Output per worker has become too big to fail. Your greed and stupidity by then is simply outmatched by the productive capacity of the economy. Let us then define the capital-output ratio as the symbol kappa \\(\\kappa\\).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{15}\n\\kappa = \\frac{K}{Y}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis then gives us a path to a different accumulation equation involving the KY Ratio when looking at \\(\\dot{K}\\) as a growth series \\(G^{K}\\) by first altering (4) to (16)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{16}\nG^{K} = \\frac{s}{\\kappa} - \\delta\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAnd second by using the \\(G^{Y}\\) that was previously derived. Using these two we can derive \\(G^{\\kappa}\\) given that\n\\[G^{\\kappa} = G^{K} - G^{Y}\\]\nGiving us\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{17}\nG^{\\kappa} = (1-\\alpha)(s(n+g+\\delta)\\kappa)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIntegrating and again saving on notation we get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{18}\n\\kappa(t) = [\\kappa_{0} + \\frac{s}{d}+\\exp(-bdt)-\\frac{s}{d}]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(k_{0}\\) is the inital capital-output ratio and \\(d=n+g+\\delta\\) and \\(b=1-\\alpha\\). To be able to use this to do computations though, we need to convert into a discrete equation.\n\\[\\kappa_{t+1} = \\kappa_{t} + [\\frac{1-\\exp(-(b)(d))}{d}](s- (d)\\kappa_{t})\\]\nThis gives us the discrete solution \\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{19}\n\\kappa_{t+1} = \\kappa_{t} + (1-\\alpha)(s - (n+g+\\delta)\\kappa_{t})\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAlright, now we will use the various equations we gave here for computations. Before we do that we must alter equation (19) to make it stochastic so that we may simulate the real world accurately. To do that we will add a stochastic sequence to savings called \\(\\{X_{t}\\}\\) which will formally be a representation of shocks to a country’s Net Foreign Assets position over time. With that detail included in the solow model, although it is a closed economy model, it will become a complete model by borrowing all the closed economy formalism that was set up in Macroeconomic Laws 1 and their equivalence relations, and with that, we will see, that Macroeconomics is just as deterministic as physics. So (19) becomes (20)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{20}\n\\kappa_{t+1} = \\kappa_{t} + (1-\\alpha)((s + \\{X_{t}\\}) - (n+g+\\delta)\\kappa_{t})\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe can now turn to deciding the method to test conditional convergence. Remember our aim here, it is here to replicate the real world data using (20). We need an objective way to choose the ranges of our random sequences. We will do that by relying the exchange rate performance of any country and its exchange rate regime. We will have two broad ‘scenario bundles’. The fixed exchange rate regime who either appreciated or depreciated. The floating exchange rate that either appreciated or depreciated. All countries out there will fall into one of these categories at any point in time depending on the boundaries you will pick. So we will have four different \\(\\{X_{t}\\}\\) that explains the movement of any region’s exchange rates, via the presets : \\(PA\\) meaning Pegged Appreciation, \\(PD\\) meaning Pegged Depreciation, \\(FA\\) meaning Float Appreciation, and \\(FD\\) meaning Float Depreciation.\n\\[ \\{ X^{PA}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R} :  X^{PA} \\sim \\mathbb{U}[0, 0.35) \\} \\]\n\\[ \\{ X^{PD}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R} :  X^{PD} \\sim \\mathbb{U}[-0.35, 0) \\} \\]\n\\[ \\{ X^{FA}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R} :  X^{FA} \\sim \\mathbb{U}[-0.1, 0.35) \\} \\]\n\\[ \\{ X^{FD}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R} :  X^{FD} \\sim \\mathbb{U}[-0.35, 0.1) \\} \\]\nFor our first test of the model, all countries will have the same parameters, except for their random sequences and their initial capital-output ratios. We will model for 64 periods meaning from 1960 to 2024. This will be our baseline. We are not looking to model the real world accurately just yet. First we must look at the effect that the shocks on NFA contributes in practice to the capital-output ratios’ and we must judge whether this starting point is fair and reasonable to these regions / countries by considering how their prices / exchange rates moved. The numbers will speak for themselves. You will get what I mean in a second. I will be using \\(\\kappa_{US} = 3\\), \\(\\kappa_{SG} = 1.5\\), following available statistics, and will be using \\(\\kappa_{MU} = \\kappa_{SSA} = 1\\).\n\n\nShow the code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n\nsns.set_context('notebook',font_scale=1)\nsns.set_style('ticks')\n\n\nclass Solow:\n    \n    \"\"\" \n    Built upon and modified from Stachurski-Sargeant and Brad Delong \n    &lt;https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/python_oop.html&gt;\n\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, n=0.02,              # population growth rate\n                       s=0.3,              # savings rate\n                       δ=0.03,              # depreciation rate\n                       α=1/3,               # share of capital\n                       g=0.02,              # productivity\n                       κ=1, # current capital-labor ratio\n                       A=1,               # current efficiency of labor\n                       L=1.0,\n                       upper=0.1,\n                       lower=-0.1,\n                                ):              # current labor force  \n\n        self.n, self.s, self.δ, self.α, self.g = n, s, δ, α, g\n        self.κ, self.A, self.L, self.upper, self.lower = κ, A, L, upper,lower\n        self.f = np.random.uniform(self.lower,high=self.upper)\n        self.Y = self.κ**(self.α/(1-self.α))*self.A*self.L\n        self.K = self.κ * self.Y\n        self.y = self.Y/self.L\n        self.g_k = ((self.s+self.f)/(self.κ) - self.δ)\n        self.g_y = (self.α*(self.g_k-self.g-self.n)+self.g)\n        self.g_Y = self.α*(self.g_k)+(1-self.α)*(self.n+self.g)\n        self.MPK = self.α*(self.Y/self.K)\n        self.initdata = vars(self).copy()\n        \n    \n    \n    def calc_next_period_kappa(self):\n        \"Calculate the next period capital-output ratio.\"\n        # Unpack parameters (get rid of self to simplify notation)\n        n, s, δ, α, g, κ, f = self.n, self.s, self.δ, self.α, self.g, self.κ, self.f\n        # Apply the update rule\n        return (κ + (1 - α)*( (s+f) - (n+g+δ)*κ ))\n\n    def calc_next_period_A(self):\n        \"Calculate the next period efficiency of labor.\"\n        # Unpack parameters (get rid of self to simplify notation)\n        A, g = self.A, self.g\n        # Apply the update rule\n        return (A*np.exp(g))\n\n\n    def calc_next_period_L(self):\n        \"Calculate the next period labor force.\"\n        # Unpack parameters (get rid of self to simplify notation)\n        n, L = self.n, self.L\n        # Apply the update rule\n        return (L*np.exp(n))\n    \n\n        \n    def update(self):\n        \"Update the current state.\"\n        self.f = np.random.uniform(self.lower,high=self.upper)\n        self.ts = self.s + self.f\n        self.κ =  self.calc_next_period_kappa()\n        self.A =  self.calc_next_period_A()\n        self.L =  self.calc_next_period_L()\n        self.Y = self.κ**(self.α/(1-self.α))*self.A*self.L\n        self.K = self.κ * self.Y\n        self.y = self.Y/self.L\n        self.k = self.K/self.L\n        self.g_k = ((self.s+self.f)/(self.κ) - self.δ)\n        self.g_y = (self.α*(self.g_k-self.n-self.g)+self.g)\n        self.g_Y = self.α*(self.g_k)+(1-self.α)*(self.n+self.g)\n        self.MPK = self.α*(self.Y/self.K)\n\n\n    def generate_sequence(self, t, var = 'κ', init = True):\n        \"Generate and return time series of selected variable.

Singapore and America still soars, because they move above the threshold of output per worker and KY Ratio where it simply no longer matters, even if corruption plus incompetence is present.

Maybe we should continue to bring real world data in now, in the form of labor for all regions, that we covered previously in the chart on conditional convergence.

Let us also differentiate between the capital-output ratio of the economies so as to be able to reflect the data more accurately and use their real world capital shares. With regards as to how I came to the final numbers, I relied on the Penn World Tables initially to use their KY ratios of these regions in the 1960’s to make the first test runs and IF that did not work, I looked for KY ratios that best reflected real data.

Did you really think it was possible to be 50x more productive in the span of 64 years when singapore was only ~20x more productive.\nIt’s not. Let us not downplay what China has accomplished though. Let’s not do that. It is the single most extraordinary thing of this century. It progressed faster than Singapore. You cannot expect more than that. The amount of people it has lifted out of poverty is extraordinary. Now, if you want to do other countries, you should remember that \\(g = \\frac{\\dot{y}^{*}}{y^{*}}\\) is your potential output growth rate. So for europe it would be \\([0,0.02]\\). In fact if you wanted to predict rather than test convergence for ‘your economy’, you would use \\(\\alpha=0.33333\\) and calibrate \\(g\\) appropriately and use the appropriate \\(\\kappa\\) to get spookily close to real world predictions.\nLook on the bright side. Lots of countries play with numbers, not just yours. See, economics is deterministic too. A ahem ahem - how might you call it again? A science thingy? Ah yes a social science.",

    "text": "The situation of the Republic of Mauritius has been catastrophic for a lot of years now. I wish it was possible for me to explain all of this to you without mathematics. But it is not possible, because it would be my words against the current government’s lies. That is a bad standard to set. It would basically be me telling you to believe my propaganda, versus the government’s propaganda. Here is the thing, I should not have to convince you. There is no need for any propaganda of any kind. I should not have to convince you that gravity exists. If you drop something, you can observe that it will fall down according to the laws of classical mechanics. Just like physics, economics is a deterministic field of study. It has its laws too. It is just not explicitly taught that way because it is a social science. I am going to teach you a simple way to think about macroeconomics in this paper that will help you understand not only the economy of the Republic of Mauritius but any economy in the world. It is slightly hard, if you do not know calculus. That does not mean, you should just give up. Hit a friend up. Tell them to teach you. Do not be ashamed if you do not understand this. This is not easy to understand. But do not run away. Your future is at stake. I am doing what no politician has ever done with you, treat you with respect. You the young people, who understands this, I need you to do your part too. Explain what is in this paper, to people around you who cannot understand it. You need to embrace that, I cannot do everything. You have a very important part to play in all of this if you are educated enough. If you want a country where you could easily be the richest because you know inside you, that you have what it takes. If you want to be the president one day. You have to play your part now to make it possible for you and your own kids tomorrow.\nIf you understand this paper, you will finally understand that all the economic statistics of the Republic of Mauritius are wildly fake these days. We are on the brink of total collapse more than ever. All it takes, is capital flight from GBC deposits. Even something as small as, one billion dollars worth of deposits being claimed would force banks to buy a lot foreign currency breaking the exchange rate, to honor their liabilities. In some cases, some would be forced to sell assets by marking them to market, in the process hurting their books and in all likelihood breaking the banking system as a whole which is not solid at all. You see, these days, Mauritius is just bankrupt. It has been for a long time. But that is the problem with invented governments that has a monopoly over their own currency. They cannot go bankrupt or declare bankruptcy. Because government can always invent an excuse and print money via the central bank. We call that debasing your currency. Around 180 billion rupees (worth 3.75 billion dollars at 48 rupees/ USD) has been printed solely via bullshit excuses to make up for the fact that the country is broke. Had they not printed that money, a revolution would have already ensued. But they made the situation so much worse, by printing so much money, allowing so much inflation just to save their necks. You have to understand that. You had to pay a price. You had to starve, so they could live another day. Just so they may continue to steal. Just so they could keep a noose tied around your necks. Just so they could keep you enslaved. That is not a bad dream I am inventing. That is the reality of the situation. Those are facts. Without you toiling everday, this country would crumble in a week. You are the only reason, our country still stands after so much corruption and mismanagment of our country. You the people of the Republic of Mauritius who go to work everyday, you are the true heroes of this story. Yet, you are all heavily discriminated these days. Foreign currency access today is only allowed to those who are in the good favors of government. It is the most discriminatory the country has ever been since its independence. There are two kinds of people today in the Republic of Mauritius. The kind who gets unlimited access to foreign currency and the kind that has to beg, to be able to send their children money. The worst of it is that faced with this a lot of conglomerates have simply, stopped selling their foreign currencies. Honestly, I cannot blame them. I would not either. I would use swaps too. Its just a good business decision. If you let go of your FCY, you would be a sitting duck as a business. You need to be liquid enough and government is not. You let go, of your FCY, its gone forever.\nNow, this discrimination was always true of domestic currency and still is. There are people in the Republic of Mauritius that always had unlimited access to money and generally at a reduced cost. You can use any word you want but crony is a good word. A crony can be anybody, so we should define the term. A crony is anybody who gets gets their cost of capital subsidised by the government, sometimes below the risk free rate. Now there is a peculiarity with crimes, in that most of them are not recognized as crimes and you cannot do anything about that. I cannot do anything about the free capital that government gave for 56 years. They are not crimes. They are policies, when well orchestrated. Policies that were designed to bleed you as much as possible, to please their cronies and fill their own pockets with any bribe they could get for this favor. Likewise, and it can be cruel to hear this, but politicians never explicitly steal public money. No good politician ever steals public money. Technically they spend public money which will cleverly find its way back to them. In the end, the law is what you make of it. Use it wrong, and the criminal goes free. We negligently and purposely in bad faith used it wrong or not at all for all these years. There is no need to worry though. We will rectify it soon enough. So, if no one told you yet, you need to realise that the laws in this country suck, in punishing bad faith behaviors. It had to so people could do whatever the fuck they wanted for 56 years with your money and make a joke out of the law itself. Anyway, to sum up, no country, that treats its citizens, with such discrimination can be doing well. Let us understand all of this with some basic mathematics.",

You the young people, who understands this, I need you to do your part too. Explain what is in this paper, to people around you who cannot understand it. You need to embrace that, I cannot do everything. You have a very important part to play in all of this if you are educated enough. If you want a country where you could easily be the richest because you know inside you, that you have what it takes. If you want to be the president one day. You have to play your part now to make it possible for you and your own kids tomorrow.\nIf you understand this paper, you will finally understand that all the economic statistics of the Republic of Mauritius are wildly fake these days. We are on the brink of total collapse more than ever. All it takes, is capital flight from GBC deposits. Even something as small as, one billion dollars worth of deposits being claimed would force banks to buy a lot foreign currency breaking the exchange rate, to honor their liabilities. In some cases, some would be forced to sell assets by marking them to market, in the process hurting their books and in all likelihood breaking the banking system as a whole which is not solid at all. You see, these days, Mauritius is just bankrupt. It has been for a long time. But that is the problem with invented governments that has a monopoly over their own currency. They cannot go bankrupt or declare bankruptcy. Because government can always invent an excuse and print money via the central bank. We call that debasing your currency. Around 180 billion rupees (worth 3.75 billion dollars at 48 rupees/ USD) has been printed solely via bullshit excuses to make up for the fact that the country is broke. Had they not printed that money, a revolution would have already ensued. But they made the situation so much worse, by printing so much money, allowing so much inflation just to save their necks. You have to understand that. You had to pay a price. You had to starve, so they could live another day. Just so they may continue to steal. Just so they could keep a noose tied around your necks. Just so they could keep you enslaved. That is not a bad dream I am inventing. That is the reality of the situation. Those are facts. Without you toiling everday, this country would crumble in a week. You are the only reason, our country still stands after so much corruption and mismanagment of our country. You the people of the Republic of Mauritius who go to work everyday, you are the true heroes of this story. Yet, you are all heavily discriminated these days. Foreign currency access today is only allowed to those who are in the good favors of government. It is the most discriminatory the country has ever been since its independence. There are two kinds of people today in the Republic of Mauritius. The kind who gets unlimited access to foreign currency and the kind that has to beg, to be able to send their children money. The worst of it is that faced with this a lot of conglomerates have simply, stopped selling their foreign currencies. Honestly, I cannot blame them. I would not either. I would use swaps too. Its just a good business decision. If you let go of your FCY, you would be a sitting duck as a business. You need to be liquid enough and government is not. You let go, of your FCY, its gone forever.\nNow, this discrimination was always true of domestic currency and still is. There are people in the Republic of Mauritius that always had unlimited access to money and generally at a reduced cost. You can use any word you want but crony is a good word. A crony can be anybody, so we should define the term. A crony is anybody who gets gets their cost of capital subsidised by the government, sometimes below the risk free rate. Now there is a peculiarity with crimes, in that most of them are not recognized as crimes and you cannot do anything about that. I cannot do anything about the free capital that government gave for 56 years. They are not crimes. They are policies, when well orchestrated. Policies that were designed to bleed you as much as possible, to please their cronies and fill their own pockets with any bribe they could get for this favor. Likewise, and it can be cruel to hear this, but politicians never explicitly steal public money. No good politician ever steals public money. Technically they spend public money which will cleverly find its way back to them. In the end, the law is what you make of it. Use it wrong, and the criminal goes free. We negligently and purposely in bad faith used it wrong or not at all for all these years. There is no need to worry though. We will rectify it soon enough. So, if no one told you yet, you need to realise that the laws in this country suck, in punishing bad faith behaviors. It had to so people could do whatever the fuck they wanted for 56 years with your money and make a joke out of the law itself. Anyway, to sum up, no country, that treats its citizens, with such discrimination can be doing well. Let us understand all of this with some basic mathematics.",

    "text": "Microdynamics\nConsider real output in a closed economy.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\\label{eq-a}\ny(c,s) = c_{r} + s_{r} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad s = i\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn a closed economy there are only two things, consumption \\(c\\) and savings \\(s\\). Because of that fact, savings also equals investment when considering a closed economy. Now in macroeconomics, there are two type of statistics. One that is called a real statistic where inflation is stripped off and another one, called a nominal statistic where inflation is not stripped off. These two statistics are always related to each other, at all times. The challenge is to understand how they are related objectively, so that even if the Republic of Mauritius was faking all of its statistics (which it is doing, these days), it would ultimately not matter, because you would not need to rely on any statistic anymore. You would rather have an understanding of how an economy works. You would never need to read an opinion about the economy every again in this life. You would always know everything about any economy. Now, the first step in doing that is to understand how nominal output and real output are related. Consider writing \\((1)\\) in different real terms.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{2}\\label{eq-b}\ny(c,s) = c_{r} + s_{r} \\Longleftrightarrow y(p(c,s)) = \\frac{c_{n}+s_{n}}{p_{\\text{deflator}}} \\Longleftrightarrow y(k(c,s)) = \\frac{c_{n}+s_{n}}{k}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAs you can see these equations are related by the fact that, they all represent real output, but we do not work with real output in the real world, because governments need a get out of jail free card through money printing. We work with nominal output, because economics is ultimately a ponzi scheme based on population growth, where you pay back debt with a little growth and with money being less valuable over time, which is a process that is called inflation. Do not panic, this is true, well known and easy to derive. We will much further down. You see, the belief that government exists to protect your interests for example is a naive and dumb interpretation of human nature. It is very hard to believe with all the fluff, that government throws at you, of course. But you have to remember, governments only exist, because it is the most elegant and non controversial way to hold power over the resources of an entire country without protest. All you need is a bad constitution and bad laws for the nightmare to begin. These are both things, the Republic of Mauritius has had for 56 years. Which is why it has never progressed and why most countries do not. You are getting played buddy, there is no democracy, no fairness. There never was, the democracy your parents believed in was communalism. That is not and will never be democracy. Today, there is just you, the slave who is too afraid to stand up to the bullies of this country. The real question is do you want this to change? Then you need to force yourself to learn. You need to understand the world as it is. Now, back to business, why is it important to understand how real and nominal output works ?\nIt is important, because one affects the other. There are causal relationships here. Cause and effect relationships, which means that, \\(p_{\\text{deflator}}\\) which here represents either the GDP deflator or the consumer price index (CPI) and \\(k\\) which here represents the exchange rate, can give you useful information about any economy at any time. You do not need to know real output exactly, you can infer everything from a robust understanding of how the exchange rates, price indexes and output are objectively related. Economics is not magic. These are simple rules every economy out there will always respect. Learn the rules and no one will be able to fool you again. Meaning these are three ways to be looking at the same thing objectively, because all these three equations represent the same thing \\(y\\) which is real output. So this logically means that \\((2)\\) is equivalent to (3).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{3}\\label{eq-c}\n\\text{Real Output} \\Longleftrightarrow \\text{Real Output} \\Longleftrightarrow  \\text{Real Output}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSo even if, any government like the current republic of mauritius fakes all its statistics, it cannot fake how economics works deterministically. If you can understand that, then you are good to go. The biggest barrier to understanding this is going to be reading basic calculus notation. It is not difficult to learn if you do not know it. This is the point, where you ask a friend to teach you calculus notation by explaining the things here that are going on here. Do not be ashamed, to ask. So the first thing we have to do is understand the causal relationships between\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}= \\dfrac{dy}{dp} \\dfrac{dp}{ds} = \\dfrac{dy}{dk} \\dfrac{dk}{ds} = Productivity\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{dc}= \\dfrac{dy}{dp} \\dfrac{dp}{dc} = \\dfrac{dy}{dk} \\dfrac{dk}{dc} = Inflation\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSo from these two equations, the first causal relationship that we find is that between productivity and inflation. Productivity is the absence of inflation. An increase in inflation will always be met by decreases in productivity. Now why is that true? To understand that we need to understand the causal relation between exchange rates, prices and real output. We do that by defining the total differential of both price \\(p(c(t),s(t))\\) and the exchange rate \\(k(c(t),s(t))\\) over time to be.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{4}\\label{eq-d}\n\\dfrac{dp}{dt}= \\dfrac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{c}} \\dfrac{dc}{dt} + \\dfrac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{s}} \\dfrac{ds}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{5}\n\\dfrac{dk}{dt}= \\dfrac{\\partial{k}}{\\partial{c}} \\dfrac{dc}{dt} + \\dfrac{\\partial{k}}{\\partial{s}} \\dfrac{ds}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThese definitions have implications, namely that if\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&gt;0= k \\downarrow \\;\\; p \\downarrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&lt;0= k \\uparrow \\;\\; p \\uparrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis is where we are confronted with the first problem of macroeconomics. Equation \\((4)\\) can be tampered with and is tampered with arbitrarily everywhere in the world. Truth is, everybody likes inflation to be low because every government wants to be re-elected, so there is an inherent bias towards calibrating the index you are using to calculate inflation, with weights that favors, low inflation by design. A slightly different version of (4) is generally estimated using a Laspayes or Paasche index to obtain inflation rates as (b).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{b}\n\\frac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}} = \\pi_{t}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis paper by the US bureau of labour statistics gives a good breakdown of how (4) is estimated. Now, this is not what the Republic of Mauritius has been doing. This is what most advanced economies have been doing, understating the impact of inflation but they do not hide it. All of them have food, shelter and energy components of inflation. Our country has outright been misreporting inflation and a simple proof of this is that there are other price indexes that they did not bother to fake, like the leading indicators of inflation themselves, the PPI-M and PPI-A. The Producer Price Index for Manufacturing and Agriculture. They are the price that producers get for selling their output. Now, companies do not just pass increased costs of production on to you, they need to also have a decent profit margin, and they also need to pass on the cost of higher employment to you. That is why, there are ample reasons to believe that if the PPI-M is \\(50\\%\\) and the PPI-A is \\(97\\%\\) then the CPI is somewhere between the two. What we can say though is that inflation since Jan 2020 to April 2024 is at minimum greater than \\(50\\%\\) and close to \\(90\\%\\) given the PPI-A. I have no idea, how high inflation really has been. But you can make an educated guess. You can come to one with some principles. Notably, that government is bankrupt so it cannot give you anything. So, anything it gives will always fall short of completely restoring your purchasing power. So if we look at the evolution of the minimum wage, you should technically be better off right now, by A LOT. Are you really better off ? No, you are struggling, everybody is struggling, atleast in the middle class because the CPI is completely useless and fake. Which is why there are allowances on top of the minimum wage so the government can try to win elections. All of these things allows us to make an educated guess. Which is that inflation is between \\(90\\%-100\\%\\) for the CPI index for the last four years. Because they gave you that much. They must have taken more, given the country is broke and not in a position to be able to give you anything. We have been living on central bank money for four years now. Since November 2019.\n\n\nPRICE INDEXES VS MINIMUM WAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nPPI-M\nConsumer Price Index\nMinimum Wage\nMinimum Wage with Allocations\nPPI-A\n\n\n\n\nJan-2020\n103.2\n80.7\n9,700\n10,200\n107.4\n\n\nApr-2024\n153.7\n103.24\n17,000\n20,000\n211.3\n\n\nChange\n52%\n27%\n75%\n96%\n97.2%\n\n\n\n\nSo if you are following and understanding this writing, your question should now be, so then what is causal relationship between Equation (4) and (5). Who leads, and what is the cause and effect ? (4) and (5) are intimately related through the fact that inflation is always the leading operator which signals the direction that the exchange rate will be moving in, all other things remaining equal (interest rates). So this simplifies things, because we can now focus on how inflation works between countries to regulate their exchange rates. The first important thing is the Real Exchange Rate between two currencies.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{6}\nRER_{t}= k_{t} \\cdot \\cfrac{p_{t}}{p^{*}_{t}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis is very simple. An increasing RER means your currency is getting overvalued. Overvalued means inflation in your country is higher than inflation in the other country. Which means your goods and services are getting too expensive. So two things can happen. External demand of the goods and services that your country produces will fall if prices rise too much. Second, because goods are cheaper abroad, businesses will import as much as they can, because they can resell higher on the domestic market with a slight markup. This has been the business model of the country for the past fifteen years. We are not a productive country anymore. We have not been getting, any huge increases in external demand for practically ten years now. External demand has basically been the same. What we have been getting is massive inflows of foreign currency from the global business sector, that has allowed the rupee to stay massively overvalued. Which has allowed us to live beyond our means, for more than practically fifteen years now. But, all good things must come to an end. We cannot handle it anymore. The rupee is way too overvalued these days. It can only be overvalued because inflation is a lot more than the measly \\(27\\%\\) you are shown. The only thing reliable in an economy is permanent production which gives permanent inflows of funds. We do not have that unfortunately. We have not done anything for now like 25 years besides non tradables development. Literally. That is why there is no future today left. What does this mean ? This means something concrete economically. Can you guess what ? It means if we defined potential output as \\(y^{*}\\) then potential output is a function of the RER.\n\\[ RER \\mapsto y^{*}(RER) \\\\\n     \\frac{dy^{*}}{dRER} &lt; 0  \\]\nWhen the RER increases, the potential output of the economy decreases, meaning for any economy out there the \\(\\inf_{U \\; \\in \\; \\mathbb{R}}\\) and \\(\\sup_{U \\; \\in \\; \\mathbb{R}}\\) of the unemployment curve is determined solely and dynamically by the functional1 \\(U[y^{*}]\\). Generally we refer to \\(y^{*}\\) as the supply side economy and \\(y\\) as the demand side economy and define a positive output gap as a situation where \\(\\dot{y}&gt;\\dot{y}^{*}\\). This is the equivalent of saying that you are consuming more savings than the maximum amount that you can generate each year thus creating inflationary pressures.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\max_{y^{*}_{s}} \\dfrac{dy^{*}}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&lt;0= k \\uparrow \\;\\; p \\uparrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\nEquivalently we define a negative output gap as a situation where \\(\\dot{y}&lt;\\dot{y}^{*}\\). This is the equivalent of saying that you are generating a lot more savings that you are consuming every year thus creating deflationary pressures. Japan is the archetype example of this situation.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\max_{y^{*}_{s}} \\dfrac{dy^{*}}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&gt;0= k \\downarrow \\;\\; p \\downarrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\nLet us look at the other side now. A decreasing RER means your currency is undervalued. Undervalued means inflation in your country is lower than inflation in the other country. Which means your goods and services are really cheap. Which increases the demand for the goods and services that your country produces. This is not the situation of the Republic of Mauritius. But it is the situation of Japan. But you will have to go look at that by yourself. Think of it as a good exercise for yourself to mentally test whether you actually understood anything from this paper. Find out what the effect, of the Yen depreciation has been for Japan. Has it increased its exports of goods and services ? Why has that happened ? What is the microeconomic rationale ?\n\\[\\cfrac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}}&gt;\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}_{t}}{p_{t}} =\\; \\uparrow RER \\quad \\cfrac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}}&lt;\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}_{t}}{p_{t}} =\\;  \\downarrow RER\\]\nThe mechanics of the RER are fairly straight forward, you take yearly percentage changes in any price indicator for any two currencies you are trying to measure. If domestic prices \\(p_{t}\\) have increased more than foreign prices \\(p^{*}_{t}\\), then the RER increases and your currency goes in the direction of overvaluation. If however, foreign prices \\(p^{*}_{t}\\) is what has increased more than domestic prices, then the RER decreases and your currency goes in the direction of undervaluation. You might ask then so how does the RER adjust itself to go back to its equilibrium value ? \\(k\\) moves up or down. Exchange rate movements is what stablises the RER over time. So while it is impossible to find the unknown function to (5), we can actually use (4) to linearly approximate the slope of (5) although (7) can never be exact (deterministic) because there is no way to find out what the exact annual change in prices truly is.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{7}\n\\dot{k}_{t+1} = k_{t} \\cdot RER_{t}(\\cfrac{\\dot{p}}{p}-\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}}{p^{*}})_{t}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nLet us now do simple examples first, and then apply this thing to the USD/MUR, to show how easy it is to roughly estimate the actual inflation that the country has been going through. Do you know how inflation works ? How many years does it take for a country’s prices to double if inflation is growing 2% every year. If you thought that it is easy, its 50 dummy, well that is not quite right because inflation grows every year. It is not a linear process or \\(100 = 50 * 2\\), but rather an exponential process so your answer would be an exponential equation which takes only 35 years for prices to double.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{c}\n(1+0.02)^{35} = 2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow this is it, this is what makes the difference in exchange rates over time, inflation regimes of every country out there. Lets do regimes called (d) and (e) and you guess how they should perform against (c)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{d}\n(1+0.03)^{35} = 2.813\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{e}\n(1+0.01)^{35} = 1.41\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSo tell how the exchange rate C/D performed? It appreciated? Why? Because C’s inflation is lower than D’s inflation. What happened to C/E ? It depreciated? WHY? Because C’s inflation in this case is higher than E’s. What if the exchange rates remained roughly the same within a band of \\([-0.03,0.03]\\) percent. What would that mean exactly? That the inflation rates of the two countries you are looking at are roughly speaking, similar!\n\n\n\n  \n  Track all markets on TradingView\n  \n  \n\n\nTo be able to estimate actual inflation using this method, you must first understand why it works. Because countries can trade with each other, that means that arbitrage (buying cheap from a country reselling high domestically), will always happen to bring prices of tradable goods between countries to equilibrium. Not the price of services though. A hair cut cannot be traded and will always cost more abroad compared to Mauritius if you are using advanced economies as comparison standards. So to use this method called Relative Purchasing Power Parity, the first thing you must do, is pick a highly tradable good, that is sold worlwide and in huge quantities so that you can assume that there is always arbitrage going on for this good so that its prices are heading for equilibrium, at the very least. Such a good, is the IPhone.\nFrom the current price of the rupee to the dollar, we can assume that there has been atleast a difference of inflation amounting to the order of \\(32\\%\\) judging from the graph between the United States and Mauritius. That right off the bat is more than the again measly \\(27\\%\\) you are being shown which is clearly Bullshit. So the US had a CPI reading of \\(314\\) in May and going back to Jan 2020, it had a reading of \\(258\\). Added to our 32% that gives us an inflation of 53%.\n\n\nShow the code\ndifference_usd_mur = 0.32\nexcess = (314-258)/258 \npartial_cpi_mur = (excess + difference_usd_mur) * 100\n\nprint(partial_cpi_mur)\n\n\n53.70542635658915\n\n\nSo now we can calculate the remaining inflation that the country has gone through based on how overvalued the currency is. That is to say, we can use the RER to find out the remaining inflation that Mauritius went through in the past four years. So remember the equation is the following.\n\\[ RER_{t} = MURUSD_{t} \\cdot \\frac{p_{Iphone}^{MUR}}{p_{Iphone}^{USD}}  \\]\n\n\nShow the code\nmur_price_iphone = 105999\nusd_price_iphone = 1599\nmur_usd = 1/46.69\n\nrer = (mur_usd * mur_price_iphone)/usd_price_iphone\novervaluation = (rer - 1) * 100\ntotal_inflation = partial_cpi_mur + overvaluation\n\nprint(overvaluation)\nprint(total_inflation)\n\n\n41.9807383898509\n95.68616474644006\n\n\nWould you look at that, this can explain the rationale behind the minimum wage increases. If inflation is around 96%, then yes the rise in minimum wages and allocations makes total sense. Because the country has not been progressing so, it cannot give you anything. It can lie and say it is giving you everything, that it has been doing for 56 years now. But the best government can do is restore some purchasing power, that inflation has eroded. Not all your purchasing power though and certainly not, give you additional purchasing power. Now, what about the ZAR. Why is it that the Rand and the Rupee have barely moved against each other? Why is this pair so stable? What do they have in common might we ask that is preventing any big swing in the exchange rates? Indeed, South Africa, fakes their inflation too. Lots of countries do, lots of countries have revolutions coming at some point. You need to accept that if you seriously want to understand the world you live in. South Africa, has had as high inflation as Mauritius in the past four years.\nNow, you should really master what you have learned here. Then move on to the next portion. The next portion uses this portion. It connects to it.",

    "section": "Macrodynamics",
    "text": "Macrodynamics\nSo far, we have only looked at real ouput growth as increases in consumption and savings. We could in theory be more precise with real output growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{y}}{y}=Y\\;\\) by rewriting it in another form where it depends on population growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{n}}{n}=N\\;\\) and productivity growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{g}}{g}=G\\) which is more appropriate for analysis rather than savings and consumption. If we therefore defined output growth as the following.\n\\[Y(G,N)\\]\nIt follows that any economy or society will be fine as long as \\(G+N&gt;0\\). However, with enough time, all economies will hit a point where \\(G+N=0\\) will be reached – this is where the society in essence peaks. That point is called the peak debt capacity of an economy. That is to say, that any economy anywhere in the world is eventually fated to collapse from either decreases in population or productivity growth but most importantly by hitting its peak debt capacity. In all cases, both factors will play a part. Meaning even the best economy out there, that can be infinitely productive. Pick your favorite, be it the United-States, Europe, China, India, Russia. They will all be bested by the simple condition (A). The condition will always hold, given enough time, there is no escaping it. Economics does not work, with no perpetually increasing population, it breaks. For now though, that is the far away future’s shit to deal with. We cannot do anything anyway about such a problem. I guess make babies. As many as you can.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{A} \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial G} dG = -\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial N} dN \\end{equation}\\]\nWe can model the peak debt capacity with a logistic population differential equation where \\(D\\) is debt, \\(r\\) is the rate of growth of the debt, \\(L\\) is the peak debt capacity of the economy. We can also make the short and medium run peak of an economy depend on its evolving potential output capacity and that should be self explanatory on its own. Peaking requires a RER readjusment on your side or if you are stuck like Greece was because they used the Euro, you will need expected inflation in the rest of the world to rise considerably. That is to say, you either leave your currency area or bide your time and wait for the inflation of the rest of the world to catch up.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{8}\nY(G+N) = 0 \\Longleftrightarrow \\dot{D} = rD(L-D) \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow \\{ \\frac{\\dot{y}^{*}}{y^{*}} \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\frac{\\dot{y}^{*}}{y^{*}} \\leq 0  \\}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn fact, we can improve (8) by discussing interest rates and how they affect intertemporal growth, real savings and real consumption. So interest rates, are mappings to different real consumption and real savings combinations via the exchange rate \\(k\\) and via interest rate differentials. Interest rate differentials is not an exact science. It depends on a lot of things. But in general, for advanced economies, positive interest rate differentials, will always act like gravity and pull money to the higher interest rate currency and thus appreciate it while depreciating the lower interest rate one. If you are in a developping economy though. Even if you have a high interest rate, you are also an increasingly more risky investment. So, it might not matter.2\n\\[i \\mapsto k(i,i^{*}-i) \\quad \\cfrac{d k}{d i}&lt;0 \\]\nSo suppose, you have an economy with 20% inflation, how do you get it down? You need to increase real savings. What are the different ways of doing that? You can increase rates, so that people increase their real savings and cut consumption. Second, you can grow out of the inflation by growing the economy thus create new real savings. Third, you can cut spending as government and that cut spending would increase real savings. The Government of Mauritius has done none of those things, especially because it has not been expanding as well as has been alluded by the numbers. Which is why inflation is not coming down anymore. That should have been very obvious to you if you understood the first part. The second thing interest rates control is intertemporal growth. If you would modify (8) to add interest rates to it you would get the following.\n\\[ i \\mapsto G(i) \\quad i \\mapsto L(i)\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{9}\nY(G(i)+N) := \\dot{G} = -rG(i)  \\Longleftrightarrow \\dot{D} = rD(L(i)-D)  \\\\\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAll right now if we impose a condition to (9) to be able to model output growth and debt capacity by making the condition, to max (9), we will get two logistic differential equation to model this situation. One where debt increases to reach 100% capacity and where GDP growth races to zero 0%. Indeed, in a world of debt, economics is always a race that is happening everywhere in the world. A race to zero growth. We won our race in Mauritius in 2019 and in doing so ironically lost, because no further growth was possible, without getting rid of a big chunk of our debt. Let me visually show you the graph of the solved ordinary differential equations so you may understand, if this is confusing you. Just to be clear we want to model (10) and a fair solution to it, is solving the two ODE’s in (9).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{10}\n\\max_{G(i)} Y(G(i),N)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nShow the code\n%%capture\nimport numpy as np\nimport opinionated\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import odeint\nfrom opinionated.core import download_googlefont\n\nplt.style.use(\"opinionated_rc\") \ndownload_googlefont('Atkinson Hyperlegible', add_to_cache=True);\nplt.rc('font', family='Atkinson Hyperlegible')\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n## logistic debt capacity simulation\n\ny0 = [1] # start with 1 percent of debt capacity to go converge to 100 percent capacity\n\nt = np.linspace(0,200,num=1000)\n\nr = 0.05 # rate of increase exp(0.05)\nL = 100 # maximum debt capacity is 100%\n\n\nparams = [r,L]\n\ndef sim_debt(variables,t,params):\n\n    D = variables[0]\n\n    r = params[0]\n    L = params[1]\n\n    dDdt = r * D * (1 - D/L)\n\n    return([dDdt])\n\n\ny = odeint(sim_debt,y0, t, args=(params,))\n\n\n## logistic growth simulation\n\ny_0 = [0.1] # start with 10% growth to converge to zero growth\n\n\nr_0 = -0.02 # rate of decay\n\n\nparams_0 = [r_0]\n\ndef sim_growth(variables,t,params_0):\n\n    G = variables[0]\n\n    r_0 = params_0[0]\n\n    dGdt = r_0 * G \n\n    return([dGdt])\n\n\ny_1 = odeint(sim_growth,y_0, t, args=(params_0,))\n\nf = plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))\nax = f.add_subplot(121)\nax2 = f.add_subplot(122)\nax.plot(t,y)\nax.set_xlabel('Time')\nax.set_ylabel('Debt Capacity %')\nax2.plot(t,y_1)\nax2.set_xlabel('Time')\nax2.set_ylabel('GDP Growth')\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you understand this graph? This graph is speaking to you and telling you as you get closer and closer to your debt capacity your growth will slowly wane. That is extremely deep insight. You should only start worrying when your country’s potential growth (trend) hits sub 1%. Before that, you can chill. So the moment you hit your debt capacity, your economy will peak because it will be forced to save to repay past debts, and will therefore be unable to generate growth, because you will need to cut consumption to be able to pay your debts back. This is a deterministic and unavoidable dilemma if you have no absolute debt ceiling which is always unpopular. The Republic of Mauritius hit its debt ceiling before 2019 and peaked in 2019, but was faking its growth, therefore the debt ceiling turned out to be completely useless. It tends to be like that unfortunately. Most countries today are playing with numbers. Once you reach this point however, you have to get rid of the debt, in one way or another. You cannot not pay. That is generally the problem, because you have defaulted now, unofficially. So, you have to print money either sneakily or using excuses like the Republic of Mauritius itself did in 2019 else you cannot cover your liablities and the cat would be out of the bag. So, a popular way is to inflate it away. You see, it is always better to pass the buck on someone else or something else. That is what the Republic of Mauritius has been doing in a typical narcissistic fashion I guess. Congratulating itself in the way and even going so far as to say that it is helping you. The shamelessness is crazy with these people. They are really just killing your future which is fine for them because that way their future gets brighter. On top of that they come on camera and tell you they are doing you a favor. Sheesh.\nThe other way to deal with your debt capacity is to take it to the limit. Only advanced economies can do this, in a reliable fashion in practice. You need to be productive enough to do this. You see, if we take capacity of the debt to its limit what would the equation spit out? What is the upper bound? Let’s take it to the limit and see by setting \\(L=1\\).\n\\[\\lim_{i\\to 0} L(i) = \\frac{L}{i} = \\infty \\]\nSo, that’s cool right? You can actually hold your own, by hanging on to close to zero growth, by pushing rates down as much as you can. In the real world, you call that using Financial Repression. Most productive economies will tend to deleverage through Financial Repression.3 Financial repression is sometimes also referred to as yield curve control nowadays because financial repression is a taboo word in economics. It can also be called QE (Quantitative Easing) which is a more hip word with good connotations. It is a more smooth deleveraging by capping rates or by using negative ones, decreasing interest payments and letting inflation maul away at the debt over a long enough period of time, which is why any smartduck will prefer it, so they may steal, get re-elected, steal some more, as long as inflation is kept low enough to prevent a revolution. By doing financial repression countries engage in a permanent transfer of wealth from savers (workers) to debtors (capital owners) during that period. Which is why, it is actually the worst of solutions, given you are allowing yourself to take a lot more debt. You have voluntarily and heavily tilted the balance of power. Debt is basically borrowing against, not only future hours of work but its rewards too. Claim too much and you make it impossible for the system to continue to operate because it would be the equivalent of slavery. Finesse is needed to find the right balance. The problem with this method is, it needs a lot of conditions for it to be reliable over a long enough period of time. In that time, where all the conditions hold, you will inevitably overreach and take too much debt, because it becomes ‘’too affordable’‘. It will be too difficult to resist. Akin to taking candy from a baby. If US rates \\(i^{*}\\) rise though, you will get screwed, if raising rates would put you into default. Your exchange rate will thus suffer from \\(i^{*}-i\\) and you will get a surge of inflation. It can still work in some cases. You see, as long as you are creating new real savings, that is as long as there is growth, you can be somewhat fine, increasing real consumption. In zero growth though, you will be screwed, because debt repayments will require you to cut consumption by an equal amount for the derivatives’ total change to be zero as can be seen in \\((11)\\).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{11}\n\\dot{y}_{r}(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    &gt;0,&  y_{c}&gt;0 \\; y_{s}&gt;0 \\;\\;  c^{r}+s^{r}&gt;0 \\\\\n    0, &  y_{c}&gt;0 \\; y_{s}&lt;0 \\;\\; c^{r}+s^{r}=0 \\\\\n    &lt;0,&  y_{c}&lt;0 \\; y_{s}&lt;0 \\;\\; c^{n}+s^{n}&gt;0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nSometimes even though growth may be positive the transfer of wealth from workers to capital owners might cross a threshold where, it is regarded as slavery. Unfair. All in all, while this can feel like a genius idea. It really is not. It is incredibly selfish. That is the crazy thing though. Anything is better than paying back debt because paying back debt means having no money to steal. Let me tell you, human nature is a special kind of madness. This is the main reason why most deleveragings happen via huge spikes of inflation. You get control on spending then. You can steal public money then. Although if it is not backed by real savings as shown in \\((12)\\), it is met with a different curve of inflation that increases at an increasing rate. Because there is negative productivity (dilution of existing savings) because when \\(\\dot{y}_{r}(t)&lt;0\\), then the only thing that increases are nominal \\(\\dot{c}^{n}_{t}&gt;0\\) and \\(\\dot{s}^{n}_{t}&gt;0\\) which increases at an increasing rate which is what has happened from 2020 to now. Minimum wages increasing 90% is not a normal thing to be proud of.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{12}\n\\dot{y}_{r}(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    &gt;0,& p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&lt;0 \\\\\n    0, & p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&lt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&lt;0 \\\\\n    &lt;0,& p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&lt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&gt;0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWorse, you now see the dark side of these allocations and the horror it is trying to hide because they are not permanent. What has been happening now for four years is a catastophic deterministic consequence of an economy that is collapsing. This is what is truly happening in the Republic of Mauritius from excessive spending to try to win elections and of course stealing of public money, and hitting our debt limit. Because you cannot be gifted anything when there is nothing to give (new real savings). So, your own current real savings will need to get diluted to pay for this excessive spending and stealing. Do you understand now, why governments gladly take making your lives harder rather than doing the right thing? It is because, this is best for them. For you to suffer. Rather than them suffering, by just paying back the debts and not stealing, they would rather steal, pay the debts and cut your consumption. That is human nature for you. That is why, you have to vote competent people up there. People who will not have to exploit you this much. It is a deterministic result of incompetence. It is impossible for the incompetent to not exploit you. LITERALLY. Now, the general problem with excessive spending is that most people have no hard assets to count on, so when governments print money or devaluates their currency, they cannot get some of their lost value back via price rises in those assets. So the wealth of the lower middle class and the lower class just kind of collapses, when this is set in motion. They lose most, given the upper and upper middle class have assets that can rise in value whenever these things happen. They lose, do not get me wrong but they lose twice as less. Overall though, the deleveraging process will the lower wealth \\(w_{t}\\) of the entire country by \\(k_{t}\\) increasing as evidenced in \\((13)\\) because \\(w_{t}\\) depends positively on real output and negatively on the exchange rate. If you are wondering whether we (our country) are poorer than we were in 2020. We definitely are sadly. Still, they are richer, which is all that matters to them.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{13}\nw_{t} = \\cfrac{ \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} y_{t}}{k_{t}} \\quad  \\cfrac{d w}{d k}&lt;0 \\quad \\cfrac{d w}{d y}&gt;0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nYou can literally attribute all revolutions to this recipe, I just gave you. Now, here is the good news, as you know if you max growth via lower rates you will race to zero. However, if you put a debt ceiling up, then you can change the global minimum of (10). That is a quite the good news. Because, what you probably have not noticed yet, is that because of intertemporal growth, there are trade offs involved, in this simulation we just did. Who lived the best lives? Obviously the people who lived in the first 100 periods. So what about the people in the next 100 periods? What do they get? Close to nothing. They were robbed by the people in the first 100 periods. That is how debt works ultimately. This is you right now in the Republic of Mauritius. What do you get? You get nothing because there is nothing to get. The state has already borrowed, the money that should have been reserved for you to make your life better. Your hours of work has already been borrowed against, the money reserved for you stolen and spent elsewhere to help the private circles of politicians and the private sector. All you get to be now in this life is being a slave and going to work, so they can enjoy their lives. Cruel is it not? Your entire life has already been determined by the people stealing public money buying cars, villas, houses. Will you accept that life?\nSo, this spike of inequality in Mauritius right now was caused by none other than the Government of the Republic of Mauritius itself4. They knew GDP was fake, given they compiled it that way to be able to borrow more. So, this is a huge problem. This is what you have been voting for 56 years. The same shit happened in the 1980’s did it not? That is a worldwide problem, not exclusive to the Republic of Mauritius. Respecting debt limits and knowing what limit is appropriate is a key thing to look at carefully in the future because it is the biggest way to decrease inequality intertemporally for every Mauritian that will ever live. One simple solution is to use absolute limits like the United-States does so as to make faking statistics useless, in manipulating the state’s ability to take more debt that it can muster at any given time. One thing to avoid, is also to not increase the absolute limit every 3-4 years like the US does which makes it useless.\nDo you understand now? The value of understanding how the world works. This is a tiny sliver of the amount of knowledge that is out there. This is not even the surface of economics if you would one day want to truly understand it. Yet, I have altered the world you live in if you take the time, and truly understand the math in here. It is so intuitive. You will never need to rely solely on statistics, if you understand it. Your eyes and your knowledge of economics will be enough for you to always know, how any country is doing. Do you finally understand why the entire world, sooner or later, can only head in a spree of revolutions, as the true positions of all economies come up to surface? Only the United States is currently safe from a revolution. Unless, it recklessly puts itself in that position by taking too much debt. Do you understand now, why even though I wish, it did not need to come to that. We might very well, have have no choice.",

    "text": "Like most of you, I have lived my entire life in the Republic of Mauritius. Over the years though, there are some disturbing things that I have found out, about this country we all call home. The elites in the private sector and the public sector are legitimately the dumbest people I have ever seen in my life. They rely on the rest of the population as their crutch, to make up for their incredible amount of incompetence. That has led the Republic of Mauritius to be a country of mediocrity, that after 56 years of independence is completely stuck because these dumbducks are holding it back. The country we live in is not progressing anymore. It has not progressed at all for years. This country’s elites are so incompetent, that the government is willingly encouraging people to leave their own home, by making their lives harder and facilitating more imports of foreign workers in every sector, because they are much easier to exploit. It is akin to hitting two birds with one stone, given they also push people, who in all likelihood would not vote for them. Everybody knows that the imported labor is underpaid and overworked. Do you understand, how unkind these people at the top are? They would do it to you too, if labor laws were not here to protect you. They are conspiring with the government literally to push you away from your home. From your place of birth because they are too incompetent. So with you, they have to change tunes. They will gaslight you, and scream you are lazy, they will demean you, and scream that you are apparently a bum — When the bitter truth is that they cannot afford to pay you a decent living wage because their costs would increase too much and they would go bankrupt. Because of their own incompetence, not yours. They need slaves to compensate for their incompetence. Slaves to exploit. These are horrible people. These people will never stop. This has been going on for 56 years and it will go on for 56 more unless you stand up.\nIt’s not like this country lacks competence today. There are very competent people waiting on the sidelines, to be able to get the opportunity to help their country. You, the young people of the Republic of Mauritius, who eagerly await for someone to recognize your talent and reward you for your true worth. You need to accept that you need someone competent to be able to do that. That is never going to happen, in the current Mauritius. Unfortunately, kindness, in and of itself does not actually exist. What exists is competence. You can only be as kind as you are competent in this world. A dumbduck, on the other hand, cannot be kind. We are in a very messed up situation to be honest. You have a country filled with undeserving, incompetent people shamelessly hogging all its wealth and bullying the rest of the population. These people have bankrupted the country repeatedly over the past 56 years. At this point, I know too much to turn a blind eye. I am competent enough you see, to not need anybody currently in either the private sector or the public sector. I am more interested, in a Mauritius that does massive semiconductors manufacturing. Cars manufacturing. Electronics manufacturing. In letting a multinational like Intercontinental Exchange, open a clearing house here called ICE Africa, to establish Mauritius as the core of Africa in Finance. I am interested, in a Mauritius whose population is closer to ~6-8 million rather than the 1.4 million it currently is. I am not interested in the periphery Mauritius, that you come to, when you need to set up some funds here, to evade taxes or launder some dollars that you steal from your people’s home country as a statesman. In the periphery Mauritius you come to do textiles manufacturing. I am simply not interested in menial labor intensive manufacturing which is what we currently do. I am simply not interested in the Mauritius that exists today. It is disgusting. It is literal hell. All it does is exploit, exploit, exploit. It is a prison. It is all it claims not to be. I am not interested in the dumbducks or their future, wealth or prosperity. I could not give less of a fuck about protecting their interests. I am interested in you, the young people. The unused talent of this country. The STEM and non-STEM majors. I am interested in you, the future of the Republic of Mauritius. Because I cannot do this alone. I need you, the competent people to take a stand. Together, we can rebuild this country.\nBut you must understand, the very conundrum that this poses for the dumbducks. You see while the dumbducks are a rare breed, because there is so few of them. They control a large part of the country. A few families control more than 65% of the entire economy of the Kingdom of Mauritius. Thing is, this country is not the free market it so likes to claim. This country is tailor made for a group people. So tailor-made, that the government had to literally destroy a conglomerate called British American Investment, to prevent it from becoming the leading conglomerate of the Republic of Mauritius. The only smart duck in town that was killed off. This is how tailor-made this country is. You are really in a fancy prison, if you are educated enough to see through the facade, that the dumbducks have set up. The majority of the people in politics in this country are families and related. Almost all of them have never brought anything to the table besides history, or the fact that they were related. They practice a modern form of inbreeding to keep their inner circle small because only two political parties have sway in the country. They both use race to do politics. Really, when you look at it objectively, Mauritius is just the Europe of the 1780’s-1800’s. It is an abomination that must end. And It will end. What has started here, signals the end of the monarchy of mauritius. Where all the laws, are carefully drafted so that the chosen elites have zero competitors and enjoy monopolies. Where trademark laws or what is known as patent exhaustion is carefully made so you cannot be a competitor to someone representing a brand from abroad. How is this a free market? It is not. It is just one of the many many lies the country perpetuates. Lots of crazy propaganda in this country, one, I remember, that was popular when I was young – is that it is the only country in the world where education and health were free. Your parents believed that lie. Even my parents believed that lie. But that is all it ever was. Lies. We call it propaganda. Propaganda exists to manipulate uneducated people. To mould them into obedient sheep. Slaves. Truth is, most countries have socialist policies. All this country has ever really done is copy laws from other countries. Truth is parallel imports would have done much more for you than free healthcare ever did. But you cannot know that can you, because you listen to their bullshit and take it as gospel.\nThe truth is they lie, and that is all they do. They are good at it. That is the only thing they excel at. I guess stealing public money is another thing most of them excel at. They make shit up to seem competent. They will pay a shit ton of money to get into a university, earn a piece of paper to fake their competence. But cannot even use an excel sheet. They are so insecure that they will abuse their authority over the police to bully you if you ever are a threat to them. Things are so bad that these days, some outright fake the fact that they do not even have the qualifications they claim. They fake the paper altogether rather than just faking their competence. That is how incompetent our country has become after 56 years. Unfortunately, because our parents were not given the chance to have the education we have been offered, they bought these lies for 56 years. They could not see through these phonies. They thought, that these people were the best of the country. That they are competent. A lot of people actually believe that. That some politicians have saved our country. That they are the reason Mauritius progressed. You cannot hold it against your parents, to have been sucked in communalism propaganda. You cannot even hold it against yourself if you have been sucked in communalism propaganda for that matter. This is your chance to change though. Unlike your parents who are probably too far gone. To be fair, everybody got sucked in from that generation. They got sucked in because they could not know better. They were denied an education. This was their education. To be racist. They were indoctrinated, by the politics of the Republic of Mauritius for 56 years. Most old people in the Republic of Mauritius are extremely racist. You should however never hold it against them. They did not choose to be racist. They were forced to be racists. We would all be racists too, had we been given the same education our parents and grandparents were given which was not one. It was a school of propaganda. Of castes. Of religious hate. Of sowing the seeds of discord and violence. Of encouraging discrimination. It is how disgusting, the politics of that generation was and still is to this day. Their definition of what democracy is, is therefore colored by all that indoctrination. Just like the definition of democracy to most North Koreans is to have a supreme leader that controls everything, because they are indoctrinated to believe that.\nFor all those reasons, it is unlikely that your parents would understand any of this. Because they are victims, in all of this, who have been abused by politics for 56 years and they do not even know it. They do not have the required education to be able to process all of this. They cannot understand that, they have been lied to, played with, by religion for 56 long years while the resources of the country were mismanaged by all the governments. Just like they cannot understand that the government is fooling them by using printed central bank money to increase their pension which will only increase the cost of living and make their life harder, not easier. You should never hold it against them. They do not know. But government knows, they are fooling them. That is what you should be focusing on. The disprespect this government has for the elderly. I would like to be very clear. Yes, the current government will go down as the worst in the history of the country but other governments stole too by funneling public money into their close circle’s bank accounts by being intermediaries rather than just service providers on all tenders that the government puts out. Do not be stupid, by thinking there was a ‘’good government’’. Good governments, do not exist in this world. That is why laws exist. Good laws are what the Republic of Mauritius needs. Nobody has done anything though for 56 long years, because they all enjoyed stealing the resources of the country when it was their turn to bat. Everybody has stolen money. You live in a country where the top companies have continuously gone bust for over 56 years, only to be given your hard-earned money so they can do it all over again. That is the law of nature of the Republic of Mauritius. In it, you are a prisoner if you are not born, in some select families. If you do not somehow suck up, to the right person, suck some bick if you are extremely unlucky, your ambitions will always have ceilings. Competence is irrelevant in this country. Because dumbducks do not have it. And they set the rules. So, to you the people of competence. You have to change the game. That is the only option.",

Where trademark laws or what is known as patent exhaustion is carefully made so you cannot be a competitor to someone representing a brand from abroad. How is this a free market? It is not. It is just one of the many many lies the country perpetuates. Lots of crazy propaganda in this country, one, I remember, that was popular when I was young – is that it is the only country in the world where education and health were free. Your parents believed that lie. Even my parents believed that lie. But that is all it ever was. Lies. We call it propaganda. Propaganda exists to manipulate uneducated people. To mould them into obedient sheep. Slaves. Truth is, most countries have socialist policies. All this country has ever really done is copy laws from other countries. Truth is parallel imports would have done much more for you than free healthcare ever did. But you cannot know that can you, because you listen to their bullshit and take it as gospel.\nThe truth is they lie, and that is all they do. They are good at it. That is the only thing they excel at. I guess stealing public money is another thing most of them excel at. They make shit up to seem competent. They will pay a shit ton of money to get into a university, earn a piece of paper to fake their competence. But cannot even use an excel sheet. They are so insecure that they will abuse their authority over the police to bully you if you ever are a threat to them. Things are so bad that these days, some outright fake the fact that they do not even have the qualifications they claim. They fake the paper altogether rather than just faking their competence. That is how incompetent our country has become after 56 years. Unfortunately, because our parents were not given the chance to have the education we have been offered, they bought these lies for 56 years. They could not see through these phonies. They thought, that these people were the best of the country. That they are competent. A lot of people actually believe that. That some politicians have saved our country. That they are the reason Mauritius progressed. You cannot hold it against your parents, to have been sucked in communalism propaganda. You cannot even hold it against yourself if you have been sucked in communalism propaganda for that matter. This is your chance to change though. Unlike your parents who are probably too far gone. To be fair, everybody got sucked in from that generation. They got sucked in because they could not know better. They were denied an education. This was their education. To be racist. They were indoctrinated, by the politics of the Republic of Mauritius for 56 years. Most old people in the Republic of Mauritius are extremely racist. You should however never hold it against them. They did not choose to be racist. They were forced to be racists. We would all be racists too, had we been given the same education our parents and grandparents were given which was not one. It was a school of propaganda. Of castes. Of religious hate. Of sowing the seeds of discord and violence. Of encouraging discrimination. It is how disgusting, the politics of that generation was and still is to this day. Their definition of what democracy is, is therefore colored by all that indoctrination. Just like the definition of democracy to most North Koreans is to have a supreme leader that controls everything, because they are indoctrinated to believe that.\nFor all those reasons, it is unlikely that your parents would understand any of this. Because they are victims, in all of this, who have been abused by politics for 56 years and they do not even know it. They do not have the required education to be able to process all of this. They cannot understand that, they have been lied to, played with, by religion for 56 long years while the resources of the country were mismanaged by all the governments. Just like they cannot understand that the government is fooling them by using printed central bank money to increase their pension which will only increase the cost of living and make their life harder, not easier. You should never hold it against them. They do not know. But government knows, they are fooling them. That is what you should be focusing on. The disprespect this government has for the elderly. I would like to be very clear. Yes, the current government will go down as the worst in the history of the country but other governments stole too by funneling public money into their close circle’s bank accounts by being intermediaries rather than just service providers on all tenders that the government puts out. Do not be stupid, by thinking there was a ‘’good government’’. Good governments, do not exist in this world. That is why laws exist. Good laws are what the Republic of Mauritius needs. Nobody has done anything though for 56 long years, because they all enjoyed stealing the resources of the country when it was their turn to bat. Everybody has stolen money. You live in a country where the top companies have continuously gone bust for over 56 years, only to be given your hard-earned money so they can do it all over again. That is the law of nature of the Republic of Mauritius. In it, you are a prisoner if you are not born, in some select families. If you do not somehow suck up, to the right person, suck some bick if you are extremely unlucky, your ambitions will always have ceilings. Competence is irrelevant in this country. Because dumbducks do not have it. And they set the rules. So, to you the people of competence. You have to change the game. That is the only option.",

    "text": "The Monarchy of Mauritius\nIn essence, what has been happening in Mauritius for 56 years is what was happening in Europe when Kings and Queens ruled. The monarchy was filled with dumbducks. They had to put their people through increasingly more and more misery, as time went on, the more they let them rule and bully them. It is literal hell these days if you are someone young looking at what the Republic of Mauritius is turning into. The smugness of dumbducks who knows they only got what they got because of privilege is killing this country. The abuse that everyone around them must endure in their workplace is ridiculous. The monarch of Mauritius are experts at how to magically and shamelessly forget they stole public money and how both political parties allow the import of all the drugs in the country. The most ridiculous thing about all of this, is that they believe they are fooling you, like they fooled your parents for fifty six years. They are arrogant as fuck. They are killing people literally with all the drugs they import. They think you do not know, it is them. That both parties have dabbled in it at some point in the last 56 years at the very least. It is so disrespectful, to think this lowly of the young people of this country. I do not even understand, how these people can show their faces everyday, come on camera and talk the shit they do. Do you hear yourself? Do you have dementia or something? I am genuinely impressed at this level of shamelessness, I have to admit. But this should be proof to you that they will not stop bullying you and killing the children of this country until you do something about it. These people literally don’t give a fuck about anything but their pockets.\nThere are a lot competent people today in the Republic of Mauritius. But they do not come from the right family. The right political party. They do not come from the right race. They do not come from the right caste. They do not come from the right skin color. In the past, all these things, these made up bullshit arbitrary rules, like caste, religions were used to brainwash your parents, to divide this country, so that the dumbducks could rule. Politicians made this country more and more racist because it was the only way for them to win for 56 years by pitting you against each other. By dividing us into castes, religions, and forcing us to recognize how we are different from each other rather than embracing how we are all alike. It is a pity that religion sided with them for some money under the table. Using god for your own selfish and disgusting interest? Like politician, like religious leader. Must be nice. To have the ability to be so shameless. However, we do not have to continue with that tradition of doing politics with race and religion. I have no need for it. I am religious person who actively practices and respects god. I personally would not mind legislating so it is impossible to do politics with religion hereon. As for race, that is up to you to hold your politicians to a better standard onwards. Come on now, this is for the best, for the whole country. We want meaningfull, educated speeches from politicians. The trash should sort itself out of politics if such a law is passed. I am hoping with your help, we can truly turn a new leaf, where we will live by new rules. Principally, of letting education finally do its job. Of allowing competence to bloom. There is no other way. We need the most competent to be given the opportunity to become the richest in this country. So the most competent can make this country an advanced economy with their hard work. The first step is to do that is to understand the prison you live in, so as to not repeat your parents’ choices for 56 years that have shaped your own destiny, to bring you here. Helpless, with no future. Do you want your own child to go through this kind of abuse tomorrow again 56 years in the future ? Then it is time to stop the bullies.\nYour parents could not understand these simple truths because they have been brainwashed. They cannot understand that American presidents have in no way shaped the success of America like its people and its immigrants. They cannot understand this bitter truth, that is nonetheless true — That The Republic of Mauritius has only been held back by its politicians for 56 years. All of them have misused the resources of this country. They have condemned it by their actions to become as poor as it did today. That is simple cause and effect. Basic science, your parents cannot understand. Dumbducks have condemned your life to become so hard. And it will only get harder, each extra day you allow them to bully you. The dumbducks are the source of all your misery not all your success like your parents have been brainwashed to believe. That is what all these politicians and private sector people really are. Bullies, who use the state’s resources to their leisure. I wish they were geniuses and competent people. My life would be easier. Your life would be easier. You think Microsoft and Nvidia managers complain that Bill Gates and Jensen Huang were too competent that they made them millionaires over night? Nobody would complain if the dumbducks were competent, not even me. Our lives would be so much easier. They are not though. But you are. You are competent and among you there are geniuses. You could replace these people, if you were good enough, easily in a free market. I will make this country a completely free market so that anyone can take on any conglomerate and actually WIN if they are better than them.",

    "section": "Appealing The Heavens",
    "text": "Appealing The Heavens\nNow here is the thing, either you put an end to the bullying, via elections before it’s too late. Or we will eventually go into a revolution at some point in the future. It is as simple as that. The country has been bankrupt for a long time now. No political party coming into power will change that fact. There is no magic ingredient. To stop this, you need to acknowledge this does not work. What has been done for 56 years never worked. That’s a fact. Not an opinion. Repeatedly, the country went bust, which is why there were devaluations each time, like right now. The country went bust because state resources went into the bank accounts of politicians and their closed circles. Who simply stole your tax money and increased your suffering. Every time they stole, they diluted the real wealth of the country. Your wealth had to decrease, for theirs to increase. You do not have much wealth left today. Do you understand, why all revolutions happen? People do not simply wake up wanting to kill their state leaders. It is years of suffering that has been bottled up that explodes.\nWhich is why, I need you to understand what you are getting yourself into right now. This is a fight for freedom. For liberty, to end the opression of the monarchy of Mauritius once and for all. What is happening in Mauritius is not an isolated event. It is happening all over the world. This is what always happens. Human beings are pieces of shit. It is human nature. Some are competent pieces of shit. Some are incompetent pieces of shit. I am a competent piece of shit. You are most likely a competent piece of shit too. They are not. Do you think the United States has no corruption? Every country has A LOT of corruption. It is just how things are. It is sad certainly. But it speaks volume of human nature. The country that progresses though, has competent people in the private sector to compensate for their dumbducks, in the public sector and they have laws that work. You are allowed to steal, but if you get caught stealing, tough luck. You played and lost. Go to prison now, do the time. We have nothing. No working laws. We have dumbducks in both sectors. Today, Mauritius finds itself in a situation where it is actually riskfree to steal given nothing will happen given there is no justice anymore. Nothing works. There is nothing left in this country. It is possibly the worst banana republic on earth. Everything is controlled by the Prime Minister, like a King once had control in Europe. That is why the country is sliding at a much faster pace than before. There is no discipline when everybody knows there will be no consequences because the rule of law is dead.\nSo remember, if you are in, this is our fight, not our parent’s fight. Your parents cannot understand. Mine cannot either. You might think, well that is weird. But it is exactly how revolutions happen. People who are not indoctrinated or who are very educated are the people who participate in it. That means young and older educated people. American Revolutionaries were from these two groups joining forces alone. Have you ever read the United States Declaration of Independence?. You really should. You will see all the similarities that the then Great Britain had with the current Kingdom of Mauritius. I need you to understand and accept that you live in a country with zero democracy, on your own. With a King, who is unleashing his tyranny and needs to be stopped at all costs. Please do not commit to a fight you do not believe in. Just do not do that ever. You have to be in this for you. For your future after you can recognize that it no longer exists right now in our current Mauritius. Do not join a movement like this on a whim. This is not a game. Read everything that I have written. Not just this paper, read all papers, and learn the whole truth of what has been actually happening in your country for the last ten years. Then make your decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Declaration of Independence\n\n\n\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\n\n\nYou see, appealing the heavens is a serious thing. John Locke used it a metaphor to explain how every human being has the right of revolution whenever they are denied their natural rights which are life, liberty and their pursuit of happiness by their ruler or state. You are being denied those things heavily in Mauritius today as I will be showing you in the other papers. Those rights are natural rights, in that they supersede any man made law. As for the literal meaning of appealing the heavens, the last passage of the declaration expounds what it means. It means to let god decide who is worthy of winning. The United States appealed to a higher power in their declaration telling god, you choose the winner buddy. We think what great britain is doing is wrong and we are prepared to bet our lives on it to fight for our liberty and our pursuit of happiness. The United States never wanted to go that far, they were forced to go that far by Britain denying them their Independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Declaration of Independence\n\n\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\n\n\nThe truth is this country was never fought for, not in 1968, not ever. The UK was royally fucked, when they lost India. They had no more bodies to send to die in colonies to further their oppression. After the Algerian war, it was simply a bad political choice to hold on to colonies, unless you had non-voting bodies to throw at them. You would lose elections which is why, the UK let go as did France of its colonies. Now, you want to thank someone. Thank all the people, who bravely fought and died for your freedom in the Algerian revolution, because they are the real cause, the entire African continent, finally got liberated. That is a fact buddy. Again not an opinion. Simple cause and effect. All our representatives ensured is that we would one day become a banana republic. That this day would come. That is a bad way to ensure democracy if you ask me. Especially when the original way of handling elections, which the British proposed included proportional representation. That would have done more than anyone has ever for the past 56 years, to ensure democracy in this country, but we did not want democracy, so we forced first past the post on a country of uneducated people and a pseudo proportional representation based on raciality. To make race and communalism the game for 56 years. ON PURPOSE. They simply did not give a fuck about you then and neither do they now. They got what they wanted. Power and access to the state’s resources for 56 years. What do you want? Anybody ever ask you that in 56 years?\nI write this anonymously for a simple purpose. I wish to end this here, all by my lonesome by convincing you with good old reason and maths. Not with war, not with a revolution. I am a complete nobody and that is fine with me for now atleast. It is why I can afford to be so real with you. The magic of the internet, and anonymity over it. I will vote for the labour party in the coming elections and if you wish to show support of me, I hope you will vote the labour party as well. I know, the labour party is not great. I get that even the labour party steals. I get that the labour party has not been very different from the other party who ‘ruled’ this country. I cannot do anything about the past of the labour party, nor do I wish to destroy the heritage of this country. I think our country has a great heritage. Perfection is not a real thing. It is time you opened your eyes to the real world and stopped living in a delusional one. This is what happens in all countries, not just in Mauritius. The horror which the politicians hide from you as well as the good which they will always exacerbate because they are talking of their fathers’ (as they should). Both are important things to remember so we do not repeat the same mistakes over and over. Honestly, it does not bother me if you think of this country’s fathers fondly. As you should, they were ultimately good people with flaws. Just do not dare forget their flaws.\nI would like to make a true democractic country where anybody will be able to head the Second Republic. We can only break this taboo, if we make the head of state a president rather than a prime minister. Where everybody goes to the polls to vote one guy or girl. That is the only way to break the taboo of communalism. It will not happen overnight, but it will happen eventually. All it takes is a competent woman or man from any minority group to step forward and prove his dedication to the population. I unfortunately am from the majority hindu group but I am sure, that a potential and competent President from a minority will show up eventually, one day. My vision of the Second Republic does not have a presidential mandate limit. A president is elected for 6 years. The president will have his own cabinet or administration. The president will have the task to make a budget proposal to the house every year, who will need to discuss it and vote on it. There will be no prime minister. We are not that big a country to need it. The president is the head of government and of the state. The country will have parliamentary elections every three years instead of the current five so people may actively show if they have confidence in their president’s party. We will not have a senate, we do not have the population for that. Most important nominations will come from the president and will be handled by committes of parliament ultimately requiring 2/3 bipartisanship, so as to safeguard against despotism. Bills will require a small bipartisanship effort most times with them requiring 3/5 votes to pass to the president for signing. Presidents will be able to veto any bill that passes that way unless the president is countered with a 2/3 vote of parliament.\nI want to completely decentralise police powers to districts and have them co-operate with a state department (who will keep districts in check) that is heavily regulated by parliament, free from any presidential control besides nominating an independent head (by law) which will need to be accepted by parliament. By law parliament can make the acceptance of nominations as hard as parliament wants it to be able to safeguard democracy because they will be in total control. Same thing can be done with Central Bank Governors. These things are set by law, not by the president. So, parliament will be more powerful that the president in this setting and will actively be able to put checks and balances on him, so the president cannot do whatever he wants. The president will no longer make the law, unlike the prime minister now who is a King, he will merely carry out laws passed by parliament, meaning he will ‘’take care that the Laws be faithfully executed’‘. I want a bill of rights, that kills reasonable suspicion for arbitrary arrests that are used for the intimidation of the population currently and want to finally bring in probable cause as the correct standard. I want a country that severly reprimands a police officer for planting drugs into the home of an innocent civilian, by making him lose his state pension should he be found guilty of such an accusation in a court of law. I want to make it compulsory to not only educate our kids about their new consitution, but I want us to take maths extremely seriously as a country. I want education to be compulsory until you are 18 or can pass a hard enough maths test to leave highschool. I have no desire to keep our kids stupid. I want us to be honest with our kids about the fact that their past leaders stole, had flaws, were imperfect, and that this a natural thing that happens everywhere in the world, and yet it is okay to be proud of them if they so wish, if only for their contribution to the development of their nation. I want us to be real with our kids unlike the last 56 years. They are our future. This is the kind of leader, that I want to be for the labour party and the Second Republic of Mauritius. I cannot say whether the labour party will accept me or not. I am tending an olive branch to them, so they may keep their place in history along with their fathers’ history. If they are smart enough, they will take it. If they are not, I’ll eventually create something new, and wipe the slate clean completely if the support for such a Republic is here.\nAfter all, what I want and what you probably want as well, is what no party has wanted for 56 years. Real independence. Real democracy. For the Kingdom of Mauritius to become finally and permanently become The Republic of Mauritius by giving it a real system of checks and balances where each branch of government can actually keep the other in check. That is the real challenge for our country. To make a system that can outlast me and anybody that comes. To not fall into the despostism we have been entrenched and stuck in for the last 56 years. To make a system that will resist even the most crooked president our country might one day have. Our current one did not. We are completely broke as a country.\nIn any circumstances, appealing the heavens is a terrible thing and I wish to avoid it at all costs. It is not kind. But I am simply being real with you as to what is potentially ahead. I am resolved to do what must be done if it comes to it. You must be prepared for this eventuality too, if it comes to it, if you want to partake in this fight for the country’s independence. I sincerely hope I alone am enough. It is possible that with enough popular support, that I alone will be enough. Whether war comes however, is not on me or you. I have not been Prime minister of the Monarchy of Mauritius for 56 years. You have not either. What comes is on them. These successive governments for 56 years. That is valid for the entire world. The dumbducks of this world caused whatever is coming by being shit governments and by stealing all the resources of their countries. Not me, not you, or even you internet foreigner who lives in another country. You think, if everything was good with Mauritius I would be here? You think you would be here, reading this article and deeply relating to it. There is a reason for all of this. That is why, I want to avoid all of this, imperatively. You the young people with your vote, can be the game-changer that allows this country to avoid not only a revolution but the game-changer that secures your future and your children’s future, which you know currently is the bleakest it has ever been.\n\nTo be honest with you this is it for me. I do not believe in free will. I am a determinist that believes that everything is determined by the laws of nature made by the Creator of the Universe. I either become your president or die trying. If die I must, then by god’s will alone will I die, happily fighting for my country’s freedom with a smile on my face.",

Politicians do not place you very high on their priority list unless there is a vote out there to win in the near future. The same is true for multinationals. If there is no competition, then there is no need for any multinational to give a flying fuck about your health. Morality without competition does not exist. You are stuck with me grins Mesle every time it gets away with murder. Beta also chuckles when it sells your data. Plenty of such examples across time periods but you know, Europe’s degeneracy during absolutism should be a good enough example. This is why, the moment you lose democracy, it’s over, the moment you do not matter, you are kind of fucked in the real world. By the standards, I have given you here, democracy does not exist in the world currently. You tend to think, that democracy is in your vote. That is not really true. Democracy is in your market power as a population. Can you prevent the monopoly in any way? Then you are powerless. Can you prevent your state leader from stealing the next elections? Then you do not matter.\nIn Mauritius, we lost our democracy after the 2019 election was stolen. You can see in the actions that followed, how totalitarian our country became in the years that followed. The boy thinks this country is his. He thinks he is the state because he got away with stealing an election. Because your opinion no longer mattered to the boy. But you know this always happens, after an election in general, anywhere in the world, given enough time. You are kind of like a used condom for the politician then. God, it felt good to use you, but you have outlived your purpose. You are kinda an eyesore now. It is time, I throw you out but I’ll see you again as soon as my seat is at stake again. Adiós mi amor. The story of the Chagossians is kind of like that. Nobody truly cares about them but them. Anybody giving a fuck is only in it for the money or the PR. I won’t be different. Nobody will be different. The only difference is, that I could still be kind, as long as I was competent because the State of Mauritius could truly help these people then.\nNot me though. The State. You must not live in the fallacious and delusional world of a state leader who loves his people. I am not here to love you or be loved by you. I am here to basically manage a company called the ‘State’. That is it. You will probably disagree with me a lot, and hate me for my decisions. That is fine. You will thank me down the line. So expect to hate me, and yet, still vote me out of respect. I think this is important to get right and understand. I have values, where if I see an animal on the street, and I have food with me, I will feed it. Does that mean, I cared for the animal? No, I did not care for the animal. If you care, you go the extra mile. You take it home, you feed it, you look for a new owner or you keep it until it dies. Do not expect me ever to say I care for you, because I never will and I just cannot lie. I have one quality. My brutal honesty. Look if somebody told you they cared for you, like a politician, they lied to you. They cannot go the extra mile, nor should you expect them to. It is impossible for any politician in the real world to care for a random citizen. Communalism is boo hockey. It just is. At best, I can care for my country’s future. In the end, though, I can only go the extra mile for people who are part of my everyday life. You will only ever get the values I grew up with. Of that the principal is respect. No matter who you are, I will treat you with respect. And I will be bluntly honest with you. I do not sugarcoat shit. You will see it in this paper.\nSo, in what I have just discussed with you, therein lies the truth of why our Kingdom is obsessed with the chagos and is bipolar in its treatment of the chagossians and agalegaens. It is because it IS bankrupt and has been for a while. Not because of its people. Not because of sovereignty. Not because it cares. Not because it has values. FUCK NO. Its MONEY. Diego Garcian money. In some sense, it feels an awful lot like destiny to be honest. Because they banked on the US to be their sugar daddy in this case for a few billion dollars and were played by the UK. They must be incredibly salty and bitter about that one. But had they gotten the dollars, they could have easily held on a few more years, and this whole thing would have been a much more complicated ordeal. It seems god itself wants this country to get rid of its dumbducks once and for all. Which is why, on to the plat de resistance, we go.",

This is why, the moment you lose democracy, it’s over, the moment you do not matter, you are kind of fucked in the real world. By the standards, I have given you here, democracy does not exist in the world currently. You tend to think, that democracy is in your vote. That is not really true. Democracy is in your market power as a population. Can you prevent the monopoly in any way? Then you are powerless. Can you prevent your state leader from stealing the next elections? Then you do not matter.\nIn Mauritius, we lost our democracy after the 2019 election was stolen. You can see in the actions that followed, how totalitarian our country became in the years that followed. The boy thinks this country is his. He thinks he is the state because he got away with stealing an election. Because your opinion no longer mattered to the boy. But you know this always happens, after an election in general, anywhere in the world, given enough time. You are kind of like a used condom for the politician then. God, it felt good to use you, but you have outlived your purpose. You are kinda an eyesore now. It is time, I throw you out but I’ll see you again as soon as my seat is at stake again. Adiós mi amor. The story of the Chagossians is kind of like that. Nobody truly cares about them but them. Anybody giving a fuck is only in it for the money or the PR. I won’t be different. Nobody will be different. The only difference is, that I could still be kind, as long as I was competent because the State of Mauritius could truly help these people then.\nNot me though. The State. You must not live in the fallacious and delusional world of a state leader who loves his people. I am not here to love you or be loved by you. I am here to basically manage a company called the ‘State’. That is it. You will probably disagree with me a lot, and hate me for my decisions. That is fine. You will thank me down the line. So expect to hate me, and yet, still vote me out of respect. I think this is important to get right and understand. I have values, where if I see an animal on the street, and I have food with me, I will feed it. Does that mean, I cared for the animal? No, I did not care for the animal. If you care, you go the extra mile. You take it home, you feed it, you look for a new owner or you keep it until it dies. Do not expect me ever to say I care for you, because I never will and I just cannot lie. I have one quality. My brutal honesty. Look if somebody told you they cared for you, like a politician, they lied to you. They cannot go the extra mile, nor should you expect them to. It is impossible for any politician in the real world to care for a random citizen. Communalism is boo hockey. It just is. At best, I can care for my country’s future. In the end, though, I can only go the extra mile for people who are part of my everyday life. You will only ever get the values I grew up with. Of that the principal is respect. No matter who you are, I will treat you with respect. And I will be bluntly honest with you. I do not sugarcoat shit. You will see it in this paper.\nSo, in what I have just discussed with you, therein lies the truth of why our Kingdom is obsessed with the chagos and is bipolar in its treatment of the chagossians and agalegaens. It is because it IS bankrupt and has been for a while. Not because of its people. Not because of sovereignty. Not because it cares. Not because it has values. FUCK NO. Its MONEY. Diego Garcian money. In some sense, it feels an awful lot like destiny to be honest. Because they banked on the US to be their sugar daddy in this case for a few billion dollars and were played by the UK. They must be incredibly salty and bitter about that one. But had they gotten the dollars, they could have easily held on a few more years, and this whole thing would have been a much more complicated ordeal. It seems god itself wants this country to get rid of its dumbducks once and for all. Which is why, on to the plat de resistance, we go.",

    "text": "Le Roi Soleil\nOur fate is strongly linked to the EU because they were the country that historically had the biggest external demand for our goods and services. So, the story goes like this, following the financial crisis of 2008 our trade with the UK took a big hit and dwindled completely over time. That was the first big blow of external demand that we got from the EU, and the second came because of Greece, where the government there was doing things that the Sun King would eventually do here. Fake national statistics to enter the european union. That triggered a crisis in Europe when the cat got out of the bag because this foolishness put the whole currency union at risk, which slowed all of Europe down. Mauritius at the time, relied a lot on EU/UK trade. This negative shock to the EU, put a dent in the progression of steady external demand bumps we were getting from them every year. Add to that US manufacturing finding alternatives for their textiles needs leading to less external demand as well, and you get what is called a current account reversal.\nDo you understand what I mean? The EU’s external demand peaked in 2012 and from 2013 started receding rather than increasing. That forced us into a recession because of what we call, a current account reversal although in 2013 statistics were embellished because elections were near so as to not show the logical effect of a current account reversal which is a sharp reversal in demand, and that embellishing has not stopped since today. We did not experience a real sudden stop because although demand waned, hot money flows did not recede from the global business sector (We are experiencing one now though since 2020). The only market we have made real progress is South Africa, which is somewhat logical because it is easily predicted by gravity models of trade when you factor in transport costs that increase with distance. So, our trade with South Africa has increased today, so much so that we are very much a periphery of the African core today, rather than our past role of being the periphery of Europe which was clearly short-lived and inefficient, because it rested principally on generous trade deals. Let us see using COMTRADE data how GOODS external demand panned out over time.\n\n\nShow the code\n%%capture\nimport numpy as np\nimport wbgapi as wb\nimport pandas as pd\nimport opinionated\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom cycler import cycler\nfrom opinionated.core import download_googlefont\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter\n\nplt.style.use(\"opinionated_rc\") \ndownload_googlefont('Atkinson Hyperlegible', add_to_cache=True);\nplt.rc('font', family='Atkinson Hyperlegible')\n\nplt.rc('axes', prop_cycle=(cycler('color', list(['#00308F','#007FFF','#6F00FF','#4C516D'])) *\n                           cycler('linestyle', ['-', '--', ':', '-.'])))\n\n\ndef reformat_k(a,b):\n  if a &gt; 1000 or -1000:\n    val = round(a/1000,1)\n    new_tick = '{:.0f}K'.format(val)\n    \n  return new_tick\n\n\ndef reformat(a,b):\n  if a &gt; 1000000 or -1000000:\n    val = round(a/1000000,1)\n    new_tick = '${:.0f}M'.format(val)\n    \n  return new_tick\n\ndollar = FuncFormatter(reformat)\nthousand = FuncFormatter(reformat_k)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = [[2000, 431,1120,305,8.94,1865], [2008, 709,1460,140,75.5,2384], [2012, 423,1350,236,221,2230],[2015,325,992,264,214,1822],[2019,209,845,202,196,1452],[2023,172,628,175,200,1175]]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Year', 'UK (USD)','EU (USD)','US (USD)','SA (USD)','Total (USD)'])\n\ndf.plot(x='Year',figsize=(11,5))\nplt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:1.0f}M')\nplt.legend(loc='best',fontsize=14)\nopinionated.set_title_and_suptitle('Goods trade collapse over time','')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, remember though that is only goods trade. There is still services trade which has been okay with tourism but lately has become impossible to measure due to global business being added to services trade rather than leaving them solely in the balance of payments. All in all, while the services trade has been steady, except in the covid period when tourists could not come in, the services trade was in no way ever exploding. That is because their capacity is much more restrictive by design (capacity) and quality (price). Do you want to welcome 2 million tourists? Too bad, we do not even have that amount of seats available per year in chartered flights by Air Mauritius. Nor in hotel capacity. Do you understand how services trade for tourism works? It does not explode. It is steady with some growth here and some contractions here and there but there are zero economies of scale to it. The problem with the services trade is that lately, it is faked because of its inclusion of GBC hot money flows, to mask our problems. But you must face reality as it is. There are foreign currency problems in our country because that artificial GBC hot money flow added to services export is not money we can use.1 When you look at the data crudely, things are just getting worse and worse, total net goods trade in particular. Let’s look at all of this in the next chart.\n\n\nShow the code\ndf = wb.data.DataFrame(['ST.INT.RCPT.CD','NE.EXP.GNFS.KD','BN.GSR.MRCH.CD'],['MUS'],\ntime=range(1960, 2024, 1), labels=True,numericTimeKeys=True)\n\ndf.set_index('Series', inplace=True)\n\ndf = df.T\n\ndf.plot(figsize=(11,5))\nplt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(dollar)\nplt.legend(loc='best',fontsize=14)\nopinionated.set_title_and_suptitle('Tourism and Real Goods and Services Export','Tourism earnings prevented us from going into crisis by giving us fresh savings, until 2020.')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n External demand was really dry for the last 10 years and that would be me sugarcoating things. The damn thing had no progression, there is no other way to put it. This chart should also let you know that net goods trade has crossed a critical point where tourism alone cannot sustain it anymore, so the government is taking loans that will hang over your heads for decades to come like in Sri Lanka where you will need to work like a slave to repay them. We do not even know how much the debts of this country really are today, everything that is thrown at you is as fake as these people these days. There is opacity in the real finances of the country. Now to be able to continue with our analysis of what really happened in the last ten years, we need more data, to be able to go on. I will give you a chart that you may need to come back to periodically, as we move along. I will be applying everything that was in Macroeconomic Laws 1 and 2 by basing myself on these statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\quad\\]\n\n\n\nSo first things first, the numbers which the government has been giving you every year are the production numbers, the expenditure number is what has really been going on which believe it or not is also complied by the government but they choose to discard it as inacurate data, and the potential output is the maximum capacity of the economy based on a Hodrick-Prescott Filter. Let us debunk the government propaganda first, before going any further. In 2012, you can see the current account peaks at a deficit of -1.5B dollars. Government claims that from 2013 to 2019 the economy of the Republic of Mauritius has been expanding. Our task is to answer whether that is possible given these indicators. Let us first look at potential output and actual output which here are production estimates. We can see that the output gap widens more and more while inflation is consistently decreasing, bottoming out in 2019 at sub 0% and close to deflation. That is a problem, a country with a positive output gap has to have inflationary pressures. Monetary policy during that time period was particularly loose. Rates were not raised once, rather only dropped lower from 2014 to 2019, and given we ‘presumably’ expanded so strongly. Yet again, inflation never came, which again does not make sense. Third problem, goods and services exports were not expanding strongly as we can see from the trade to GDP ratio, most of the expansion came from domestic activities. However, domestic activities are not ever very productive, unless highly aided by new technological breakthroughs. Do you know of anything that our country invented that could explain these numbers, did we invent a new secret technology in the Kingdom of Mauritius, besides the archaic one which is to blatantly lie to your population 24/7? Someone who works at a KFC in Mauritius where output per worker is only around 8K USD is just as productive as someone who works in DC in the USA where output per worker is over 200K USD. Someone who works as a hair cutter in Mauritius is just as productive as a hair cutter in the District of Columbia. The same goes for construction workers, retail workers, hospital workers, and any non-tradable service you want. Do you understand? Unless there was a strong population surge for the total output of the non-tradable sector to expand, the same people would not be more productive over time doing the same non-tradable work. This is why the United-States can rely on non-tradables, India can rely on non-tradables expansion, China can rely on non-tradables. Mauritius cannot, it has to expand its tradable sector. If its output growth is not coming from more trade with the world, it is fake, unless the working population has massively surged. Let’s check it out.\n\n\nShow the code\ndf2 = wb.data.DataFrame(['SL.TLF.TOTL.IN'],['MUS'],\ntime=range(1960, 2024, 1), labels=True,numericTimeKeys=True)\n\ndf2.set_index('Country', inplace=True)\n\ndf2 = df2.T\n\ndf2.plot(figsize=(11,5))\nplt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(reformat_k)\nplt.legend(loc='best',fontsize=14)\nopinionated.set_title_and_suptitle('Labor Force of Mauritius','You got conned dummy, interpret it yourself as an exercise. Remember your solow model.')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why were these numbers surging in Mauritius? Do you want to know why? Because if they faked their exports, international trade is a double entry system, it would be easy to know. So they cannot fake GDP by boosting export numbers. They can misdirect people, using services export which they did with global business hot money flows but even that, it is not a fake number, it is just extreme bad faith. You have to understand that the money did come in and did go somewhere else. Technically, you could call it an export. In good faith though, out of respect for your citizens, you would avoid it and leave it in the BoP. But this is how every country fakes its GDP. Mauritius itself faked its GDP using this production numbers boosting trick in the 1980s when shit got too ugly. Countries make their existing nontradable sectors more productive than they are and that will mess up their trade to GDP ratios. The trade to GDP ratio went below 100% in the 1980’s and recently. That is a mathematical impossibility for a small open economy. It is only possible for open and closed economies with considerable domestic resources. Let’s just prove it.\nIf an economy has to import everything it needs and engages in exports then this economy’s total trade is higher than its gross domestic product. ( Mauritius is such an economy ).\nSuppose an economy has to import everything it needs every year denoted by a list \\(m_{1},m{_2},m_{3}...m_{n}\\) for a total value \\(M\\). Let such an economy then add some value \\(c\\) to every import \\(m_{1}...m_{n}\\) by using it in each sector of the economy and in exports such that total value added \\(c_{e}=c_{d}\\). Let domestic demand and exports be the sum of their respective endowments of imports \\(m_{n}\\) denoted \\(m_{d}+m_{e}\\) which is equal to the total value of imports denoted \\(M\\). Exports are then denoted by \\(m_{e}=M-m_{d}\\). The following inequality thus presents itself.\n\\[If \\; Imports\\;+\\;Exports &gt; \\\\\nExports + Domestic\\;Demand\\] \\[Then\\;\\;M+M-m_{d}&gt;m_{e}+m_{d}\\] \\[Hence\\;\\;M+m_{e}+m_{d}-m_{d}&gt;m_{e}+m_{d}\\] \\[Hence\\;\\;M-m_{d}&gt;0\\] \\[Hence \\;\\;M&gt;m_{d}\\] \\[Hence\\;\\;m_{e}+m_{d} &gt;m_{d}\\] \\[Consequently\\;\\;m_{e}&gt;0\\] \\[Therefore\\;\\;Trade\\; &gt; \\; GDP\\]\nOur country has broken this law two times. That is a mathematical proof. Undeniable proof that the statistics are fake. Once in the 1980’s and recently from 2013-2024. It is important to note that in reality total value added for exports \\(c_{e}\\) are much higher because they involve tradables. Manufacturing for the world rather than manufacturing for your very small economy. Therefore by making \\(c_{e}=c_{d}\\) and ignoring it, the conclusion should not change. If anything \\(c_{e}+m_{e}&gt;c_{d}\\) always holds. The reverse \\(c_{d}&gt;c_{e}+m_{e}\\) implies a small open economy can ultimately progress without exporting which is just not real. This is what the Kingdom of Mauritius basically claims. That we could have higher and higher real GDP without exporting more and more. That madness is why inflation is so high close to 94% after just four years. What you are being told by the Kindgom of Mauritius is not real. In fact this relationship is real telling of economies who are faking their GDP’s because they would have to inflate \\(c_{d}\\).\nOn the flipside though it is good to note that open and closed economies often does have consequential domestic resources which makes \\(c_{d}&gt;c_{e}+M\\) always hold and by a long shot because it does not import/trade as much. Plenty of countries use that trick though, not just Mauritius but that is another can of worms entirely which is not mine to care about. There are plenty of other flaws, in the expansion story, for example, our country has a thriving local industry for food, coca-cola, beers, toiletries, detergents, soaps, milk, sauces. You know, we do plenty of stuff locally via licenses. Why is real manufacturing flat lining then, if demand is so strong? Some of that ‘output expansion’ must come out of these products we manufacture locally. Li p cachiet mo croir non ? Wa li p cachiet. Li pou vini taler la. There are holes everywhere, depending on how well you understand economics. So, let us transition to what really happened. Then we will talk about our bleak future, unless you finally wake up at the end of this paper.",

    "text": "La casa de papel\nSo, from 2013 to 2017 the current account only contracted, tell me macroeconomically what should be the effect of this? Real savings should increase. Okay, now I did not cover this but this is how it happens in real life, decisions are actually made each quarter in all economies around the world, and the fact that real savings increased from 2013 to 2017 is but a summary of all that. You must be able to know the deeper parts too, not just what goes on at the surface level. At the deeper level, what happened in Mauritius is that in the first quarter of the year 2013, inventories started piling up a lot, which made businesses in general change their decisions from importing more to importing less, which is a process that repeated itself, until 2017. Businesses started importing less because they had too much inventory already, which caused an excess supply of goods and services on the local market with dwindling demand. What does that do? It pushes prices down. What does that mean? Less tax revenue is it not? If you are importing less and less every year So, what does it mean for Government budgets? From 2014, the real numbers were always less than the ones that were thrown at you every budget. Do you ever wonder why that dam in Riviere Des Anguilles never got built? There never ever existed a real commitment for such a thing. It was something designed to fool you as were all budget speeches since 2014. Smart cities, safe cities, ‘elephant blanc projects’. They just lay down the groundwork in their budgets basically, to steal LEGALLY. They think of clever ways to fool you and spend your money. Clever ways of inventing an excuse to spend your money which will cleverly find its way back to the politician’s doorsteps as if by magic.\nFor a dumbduck must steal, because he is nothing without the people’s money. The dumbduck must live off the noose around your neck. So how did your King, make that noose tighter back then exactly? Do you know how? Do you know what actually happened to your pension fund? The NPF? Your pension fund was the liquidity they needed to supplement their budgets to cover that lack of tax money because output was no longer increasing. Indeed, you financed your own suffering unbeknonwst to you. Now is this a crime? Not really, plenty of countries do this rather than raising taxes. But they do it with finesse, so they do not ruin their pension holders’ future. If they ruined the pension holder’s future then yes, that would be a serious crime. That crime happened here in Mauritius. Your future was destroyed using financial repression.2 The NPF was willingly destroyed by the government, who used it to fund their cheaper lower interest debt that they issued themselves at rates they commanded and forced the NPF and Commercial Banks to buy because they could no longer afford to pay regular interest rates because the economy was no longer progressing. That cheaper lower interest rate, made the NPF go into more and more and more deficit over time not allowing its assets to expand fast enough, making its liabilities become a lot larger than its assets because it was not getting any return. Like the country today, the fund eventually went bust, which is why it was abolished.\nExamples of financial repression can be found here, here, here. Those are the government’s examples which are public but their cronies received the same treatment. They got your money to play with for free. Now, it does seem that things are much worse these days though. I thought only the MIC was reserved for cronies as evidenced here. To my dismay, I read in a newspaper recently that your NPF money is not only being used by the government to fund its cheap debt, it is also being used to help the government’s cronies. Your King is a real piece of work is he not? He is using your pension money as if it were his, ruining your future and destroying your retirement in the process. He is allowing people to use your NPF money without paying any interest or without demanding any collateral which is the gold standard in REPO transactions involving financial institutions, so as to insure against this silly behavior. Then again he probably does not even know what a REPO transaction is, a King after all needs not know anything, plus we are living in the Kingdom of Mauritius. So who gives a fuck about your hard-earned money and your pension. Your life’s sweat is of no importance to your King it seems. Be grateful that your King is even giving you anything I guess. That would now be the thousandth proof that you live in a banana republic. That you have a King. Now now, calm down, what are you getting all worked up for, all of this, is only the beginning.\nOur dumbducks back then were scrambling to find a solution to their biggest problem yet, a smart duck, because a smart duck was in town, and he was gaining more and more market share by providing superior services to the people of the Kingdom of Mauritius. That put the financial position of our dumbducks at risk given Mauritius was contracting and they were thus losing a lot of market share while being hugely over indebted already. They needed to appeal to their King as quickly as they could to destroy their competitor. The King responded in kind of course, but the bankruptcy of the second biggest conglomerate in the country was a big blow to the Kingdom. It ruined a lot of people’s life just for the sake of our dumbducks, so they may continue to exploit their Kingdom without competition. Then again when you ruin a whole country’s pension fund, a few people’s lives are just chump change. You see, the economy contracted yet again because of the destruction of this conglomerate which is only normal given balance sheets got messed up and borrowing receded across the board. The only company that was borrowing abundantly and expanding was killed after all. That forced our benevolent King’s hand yet again when he was shown the economy’s real performance. He had to act as a King so that the elites of his kingdom would continue to support his kingship. So he did by tightening the noose around your neck yet again and of course by lying to you by giving you production numbers rather than these numbers. Gotta give props to Statistics Mauritius though, for doing their work honestly at the time. The country owes you big time for your courage. It is okay that you gave in to the new fake statistics. The country understands how dangerous it is today to go against the government’s narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\quad\\]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\\[Y =K^{0.53}AL^{0.47} \\quad \\bar{\\alpha}=0.53 \\quad average(1960-21)\\]\n\n\n\nSo, our King forced the hands of state companies now, engaging in even more financial repression, to start investing in low rate treasury bills so he may again cover the difference between what is in the budgets that they showed the population and what is the true financial position of the state in reality. You see, the primary balance of the country deteriorated long before covid 19 although you were not shown that picture because the game was rigged. Deficits that should have been impossible, became possible because financial repression was decreasing interest payments on debt, allowing a lot more debt to be taken, which got passed as revenue. You were being robbed in broad daylight by your government who denied you of your interest, which is what destroyed the NPF. That is the truth, and in the end, things got so out of hand, that our King’s incompetence forced him to use more and more of the people’s money in all state companies to compensate for his own incompetence as well as his elite circle’s which involved the private sector. And so, in 2019, they forced the hand of companies who were refusing to give them the people’s tax money so they may have fun with it. They legislated so that government nonfinancial corporations had to give all of their ‘free cash’ to the government. Treasury certificates they called it. There is a fun story about this involving betamax which was paid with this mechanic. Also, these state companies are completely bankrupt because the state is taking away all of their free cash flow. But then they have the arrogance of coming up with shit like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZean Tirol par vavate zozo\n\n\n\n\nL’economie est au service du bien commun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa Realiter\n\n\n\n\nL’economie est au service de notre roi soleil et de ses petit copains et copines.\n\n\n\nBUT WAIT, it gets worse than this, much much worse than this because you see in 2019, becoming addicted to power, our King voluntarily pushed our country into bankruptcy just to fool your parents and grand-parents. Just so he may disrespect them and show to the world, how little respect he has for you all. His action to lift the pension permanently altered your destiny by being the final nail in your coffin. That is what made the liabilities of our country vastly exceed its assets in that year. The year 2019 was the year our benevolent King, not only stole elections like a true King would, but he also dared to touch the most important thing in a society that is the property of all its people, like a true King would. He touched your wealth by printing 18 billion rupees, to be able to debase your own wealth to pay for that increase in pensions, effectively giving you nothing while making it easier for the private sector to also pay for your new minimum wages. You effectively lost all the real value you gained for a few months after the 18 billion rupees went into circulation, into the goods and services market. In some twisted sense, covid must have been seen as a godsend for our King and his allies given that it allowed him and his close allies to again like in the 1980s with the oil shock, pass the buck on something else other than themselves. So, your King with his zeal to impoverish you, did what any King would do, he took advantage of the situation fully with emergency procurements and money printing. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. You see, the government ran out of money very quickly in 2020, and you probably did not know that because that was never reported. And so on a fateful day in April 2020, an auction about which there is no information and in which no primary dealers participated happened. 15 billion rupees was gifted to government scratch that - TO OUR KING - to be able to benevolently continue to cover your pensions. Such a graceful and benevolent King, that the heavens have blessed us with. This is already 18+15 billion.\nThat is a fuckload amount of money to put in circulation. Do you remember the identity of the positive output gap I gave you when \\(\\dot{y}&gt;\\dot{y}^{*}\\). That is happening here on steroids because our max savings are constrained to be reduced by two billion dollars because of the lack of tourists back in 2020. You can already see, that is a bad combination of things, inflation has to go up a lot now. It did, but at the same time real output just kind of collapsed in 2020 and with it the King’s treasury. Our King was now in dire trouble. The NPF was officially bust, because they could not repay both the government’s own debt principals and at the same time cover the liabilities that the government had committed itself to in terms of help i.e wages assistance, pensions etc.. The money was nowhere to be found, they had to act quickly and decisively and so to the money printing factory, our King went again and ordered a fresh supply of 60 billion rupees to be credited to his Majesty’s treasury and pre-ordered 80 billion as his personal slush fund which he called the KIC. Yet again another act of disrespect. Our King tends to do that a lot, disrespect the little people, the elderly people, the uneducated people. Seeing the zeros roll in, everybody in the Royal Court let out a royal gasp of relief and went about their usual business of stealing, until they noticed that the contraction was larger than anticipated. Tourism was a bigger part of the economy than anticipated, so they still had to cover some grounds on financing.\nAgain the disrespect rolled in, it is almost a disease with these people, rather than be upfront about what was happening, an income tax became a so-called new pension fund tax to replace the NPF. Not to an educated person though, the educated knew the NPF was bust when that happened. This would be the millionth evidence of how much your Majesty looks down on the elderly and the uneducated of his Kingdom. That was unfortunately not enough though, because the state was not generating enough real savings, and seriously risked going into hyperinflation if rather than say increase savings, the state would have poured even more freshly printed rupee notes into the goods and services market. So our crown did what they needed to save their necks. Had inflation snowballed, it would have been impossible to hide. For example, even before I wrote this, everybody knows the Inflation numbers are fake today. Now imagine, if everybody had known that as early as the second half of 2020. That would have opened the Kingdom to unnecessary risks. Now, that was a very unpopular policy though, because taxes increase savings, and reduces real output. So yet again, in 2021 we contracted albeit very minimally of course because we were already knee-deep into a hole but we did.",

    "text": "Our Destiny\nBecause of all this another problem was emerging now because the financial situation of most state-owned companies were completely in the red because their free cash flow was with the government to help them ‘bouche trou a little everywhere to make the budget not fall apart’. So their pension/retirement schemes were in jeopardy now. Everything was in serious jeopardy. So, the Kingdom needed to find new ways to sustain itself, to be able to live another day. It did that by bleeding you of the little wealth that you had left. And so began operation ‘met la population touni pou vive lor zot lasuer’. First very early on, by hiking gas prices and petrol prices to capitalise on higher oil prices and keeping them very high till today, to rip off the population to its maximum but also by adding all kinds of invented taxes, like a covid vaccine tax, an oil tanker tax, a food subsidy tax, and on some occasions our King was so smart that he taxed the tax with VAT because any excuse was a good excuse to rip people off their hard earned money. So your King could continue to sip wine comfortably in his Castle.\nWhat your King did is an action more formally called pushing a supply side indirect tax on the shoulders of your citizens. Such a hidden tax is designed by the Kingdom to take money from you without protest by increasing the costs of goods and services that the state itself provides to you to make up for the fact that it has taken all the money from state-owned companies and that they are all in the red. There are way too many examples of these things for me to list them all to you, they go from post office charges to port charges, to freight charges, the cost of electricity, the cost of transport, the cost of rent, the cost of bus fares, the cost of air travel, the cost of medicines, the cost of processing fees, the cost of administration fees, the cost of license fees, the cost of literally anything that you can think of that is state-owned, whereby a production cost increase was passed to you the general population to bear its burden because that is why you exist is it not? Do you not exist to alleviate your King’s, aches and pains as well as his private circle’s aches and pains? Do you not love your King as his royal subject? I hear the guiness book of worlds records has been seriously considering awarding our King the prize of the biggest incompetent being on Earth for being the only King who brought so many state-owned companies to bankruptcy. It is after all a world record. That Airport Holding thing, was only taken private for it to be opaque to hide multiple bankrupcies by the way. Clever this King of ours.\nSo, how does it feel to know your king did not replace radars in your Kingdom because he did not give a fuck about your safety given he controls all the drugs that come into the country and wanted the drugs to flow in as much as possible but most importantly as easily as possible. How does it feel to know that your King does not give a single fuck about you given he never replaced a depreciated boat that ended up killing a citizen of this country because of his incredible incompetence? How does it feel to know that your King could not care less about the lack of books, electricity and bus passes in schools because he likes you stupid? How does it feel to know that your King could not care less about the lack of medicine in hospitals because he prefers sipping wine and helping his cronies rather than helping you? How does it feel to know your King has done the unspeakable to one of his own? I know what you must think. Only a King can do it. Only a King has that right. That you are right about. So, is there more dirt you might ask? Of course, there is more dirt, we are talking about our King here, the best of the best. How does it feel to know, he used your overtime money and gave it to his cronies so they may survive while you starve and the rupee loses all its value? How does it feel to know that all the private debts of his cronies that he canceled in his budget were actually the overtime pay that was due to you and that you are being denied? How does it feel to know you are nothing to your King but a means to an end (a vote) given all the rupee he has given has lost most of its value? Do you realise that the rupee has now lost 100% of its value over the last four years? Do you realise that means your overtime has lost practically 50% of its face value? Do you think your King will compensate you adequately in PRB salary adjustments? Do you think your King will adjust your overtime adequately it owes you, if and when he pays you? Fuck no, that is why these numbers are faked dummy, because your King decides who gets what. It does not matter what number inflation is really at, 100%, 200%, 10000%. He has decided you will get a few cents on every rupee he owes you in real terms for your hard work because you are a slave and you must work like one and keep your mouth shut. We must be grateful and keep our mouths shut.\nLet’s talk about our central bank now. Just like our dumbducks in the private sector keeps a collection of companies where they are involved in everything and good at nothing, our dumbducks in the public sector have been keeping a collection of state owned companies that are bankrupt. The biggest of which we can add to the list is the King’s personal money factory itself, which we call the King’s Bank in the Kingdom. The Kings Bank has been the centerpiece in the downfall of our Kingdom. It has permitted our King to print money every time he could no longer afford to sip wine comfortably in his castle while pushing all his problems on the rest of the population while the rest of the King’s royal court watched in jubilation. The insolvency story of our King’s Bank begins shortly after he ordered them to print around 180 billion rupees which was around 50% of real GDP back in 2021. Most people tend to not understand this point, so we should take a moment to understand what it means for a central bank to be insolvent3.\nSo here is a very simple example of a Central Bank. It has Non Domestic Assets (NDA) valued at 30 billion rupees, Domestic Assets (DA) valued at 1 billion rupees to cover its liabilities, being Currency that is coins and bank notes valued at 4 billion rupees, Bank reserves that is commercial bank reserves held by law at the central bank and policy securities that the Central uses as instruments to do monetary policy. To that the central bank like any financial institution is one that can make profits and was started at the beginning as all businesses with an amount of capital and keeps a part of its past profits as reserves while transferring the rest to the state.\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n30\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n9\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n6\n\n\nTotal\n31\nTotal\n31\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the central bank wants to “make” a business cycle? What does it do? It creates money and buys FX from commercial banks. This increases bank reserves so they can lend more. This is called an Open Market Operation. It can sell FX too. It has the reverse effect. Notice the increase in NDA from the central bank technically buying forex from commercial banks and giving them 3 billion additional rupees for it that they can now lend to businesses and consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n33\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n13\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n9\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n6\n\n\nTotal\n34\nTotal\n34\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it thinks there is too much liquidity it can issue securities to take the reserves back for a rate of return on that money. Suppose the central bank issues a security for a return \\(r\\). This is also an Open market operation. This operation of increasing securities by 3 billion and reducing reserves by 3 billion again is called a sterilisation intervention because it cancels the previous buy of foreign currency’s effect on the banking system by removing the previous 3 billion rupees liquidity that the central bank introduced into the system so as to not affect money demand or the interest rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n33\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n6\n\n\nTotal\n34\nTotal\n34\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let us do an example where our King comes and orders an amount of \\(x\\) billion rupees to be handed out periodically over the last four years. You were lied to a lot here again because your King just does not respect you. You were told that 2 billion dollars of NDA were sold. That was not the case. None of what you were told was true. What happened was accounting tricks which if they were to come back to bite us in the ass would put a lot of people in prison for using these tricks. SVB used this trick and was fine until they were not. One fact, I must share with you is that your King plays hard and quite honestly a good game when he uses his strengths that is lying. Using fake statistics and using fake valuations. Your King is a master manipulator and a narcissist of epic proportions. Did you know, that not all the foreign assets of the Kingdom of Mauritius are in dollars? Revaluating them periodically can thus be a huge pain in the ass because of FX movements. Somehow, though our Kingdom knew the exact numbers to devaluate our rupee to so that ‘the reserves’ would shoot up the exact amount that they needed. Pssst… it did not. They just re-evaluated it as much as they needed to. Let me show you how easy it is to do it. We go from setting up the groundwork from this. Over evaluate the assets with some depreciation as misdirection to allow a new arbitrary number and a plus to also deleverage from debt. In fact, any excessive overvaluation of our NDA (NFA) as was done in June 2024 should have you be very worried because it is the first step that precedes any order that our King places at his personal money factory. It seems that our King might proceed with his usual disrespect, by giving you printed money yet again to try to fool us the slaves of the Kingdom of Mauritius ahead of elections. Do not be fucking fooled now, worthless is the money you will receive. Inflation alone will it beget you.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n83\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n56\n\n\nTotal\n84\nTotal\n84\n\n\n\n\n\nTo then give the reserves to government. It is very possible this happened again when they closed their account to declare the revaluations as profits in June 2024, to then transfer a handsome amount of \\(x\\) billion of fresh rupees, so they can spend on fooling you for those PRB and Overtime adjustments/payments. All you will get is a lot of inflation and a whole lot of nothing when you go buy your groceries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n83\nCurrency\n4\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n56\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n*\n\n\nTotal\n84\nTotal\n84\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean it is a little more complicated than that, but as I told you a King needs not know anything. The ‘Casse tete’ of cooking shit up to make this look normal is not our King’s problem, it is the audit team’s :D. Now our Kingdom was already in a dire position in 2014, with zero progress, and zero future because of corruption, so our King divided his bank’s assets strategically to earn the best return for himself as early as early as 2015 from 2014. Unfortunately, that made him become quite illiquid because with liquidity came low returns and given that low returns were bad for our Kingdom, our King’s bank delegates avoided them. So here is how it goes, you can divide your NDA into two categories, an Available For Sale (AFS) book used for short-term securities or what you would call cash or cash equivalents in an accounting class and a Hold To Maturity (HTM) book of which longer duration securities with longer maturity profiles that are more exposed to interest rate risks are a part of. So, after gifting our government with a considerable amount of money, our example central bank reached the point where suffering a loss, almost any loss woud make its equity negative. So let us look at that by going to the next financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nHTM\n58\n\n0\n\n\nAFS\n21\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n40\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nLoss\n(3)\n\n\nTotal\n80\nTotal\n81\n\n\n\n\n\nIts not that bad right. I mean when you look at it for what it is everything seems completely fine, sure our central bank now has negative equity in this financial year and is also technically bankrupt but a central has the monopoly of money, it cannot go bankrupt, it can just print itself as much capital as needed, which is what it did. So what will generally happen by the next financial is a good cooking session to recalibrate everything to get the assets up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nHTM\n60\n\n0\n\n\nAFS\n23\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n10\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\n\n\nOther Liabilities\n46\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n0\n\n\nTotal\n84\nTotal\n84\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it, Ni vu ni connu, everything is fine, or is it? Let us go back for one second. While our assets side and our liabilities side technically match. If we mark-them-to-market would its value increase or decrease? Are there unrealized profits or unrealized losses awaiting in the near future? There are vast unrealised losses in the hold to maturity book of our Kingdom. Not just because we overvalued these assets. More so because these assets are of a bigger duration profile and are thus very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Small changes in interest rates can cause big swings in losses. We got the biggest interest rate swing in practically the last 20 years in the last two years considering interest rates jumped from 0% to 5.5% in the United States. That makes for a lot of unrealised losses. Again, that is why SVB was also caught with its pants down. So let me be as clear as can be. The lying, it is everywhere in this Kingdom you live in. In planting drugs, in fake allegations, in fake reasonable suspicion arrests, in fake statistics, in fake everything, and that includes the fake position of our central bank and of our Kingdom’s Net Foreign Assets position. Our Net Foreign Assets position is shrinking obviously. Because we do not have a lot of these so-called assets if we mark them to market. We are extremely overvaluing them while very likely undervaluating our liabilities to non-residents. Our Net Foreign Assets position has only ever been in this place once before in the 1980’s. It is very possible it’s negative today, like in the 1980’s, although I hope it is not. That is why we have foreign currency problems. Unfortunately, macroeconomics is deterministic and the cause of the foreign currency problems is the same as the one in the 1980’s, a dramatic drop in our NFA if we were to mark them to market. Meaning there are a lot of unrealised losses, that our King’s bank is sitting on. Just so you get a visual idea, I’ll show you the transition in the 1980’s where we got saved by taiwan and hong-kong manufacturing coming in for textiles. There is nothing this time. We are on our own. No one is coming to save us from our incompetence.\n\n\n\n\\[\\quad\\]\n\n\nSo, is that it? Is the dirt finally over? I wish it was, but you have to realise that when a country goes bust, there is only one way to get out of that problem, it is to have productivity. We have not had that for a while now. We do not even have the adequate labor force today. We are not progressing, do not fool yourself. I just showed you that number earlier. What we have been doing is solve problems temporarily but it always snowballs into another problem. Take the Foreign currency problem, there is a very hardcore financial repression established in our Kingdom today, because if you go to change your rupees into dollars because inflation has been so high for the past four years, that is it. Government crumbles. We cannot have that, so you have to force a dictatorship where you have to even go as far as intimidate people, to discourage them from doing what is best for them. They are not allowed, they are slaves, and that is to be their destiny, that is final. Our King has deciced. Only his cronies gets access to this country’s foreign currency to protect their wealth. There are other problems, like the money that the central bank printed. It printed a lot of it. But in 2022 when US rates increased, it had to follow it, and raise rates because not following it would cause capital flight, which happened nevertheless, but more would have happened. The problem is it has printed way too much money. You do not realise it, but the central banks prints a lot of money these days to just do monetary policy because it has negative equity. It was never properly recapitalised because government itself is bust and does not have the capital. So to be able to raise interest rates, you have to use demand and supply mechanics. You have to decrease the amount of money in the banking system, but guess what? their stupidity was too costly. Just for June 2023, the cost for only the excess printed money, was as follows\n\n\nShow the code\nseven_day_cost = (0.045 *363510)/12\novernight_deposits =  (0.035*104095)/12\n\ntotal_interest_excess_money = seven_day_cost + overnight_deposits\n\nprint(total_interest_excess_money,'additional million rupees to print per month i.e 1.666 Billion Rupees')\n\n\n1666.7729166666666 additional million rupees to print per month i.e 1.666 Billion Rupees\n\n\nBear in mind, that does not include all the other already existing monetary policy instruments. They have to print money for that too to pay their interest or principals if they do not reroll them. In the end, they could not handle it, the amount of interest payments was snowballing because interest compounds and is an exponential thing that can quickly get out of control. They would have had to sell dollars to remove it from circulation, dollars we do not have. So they just stopped completely. Fuck monetary policy. Do you understand, the hard and cold fact is that the destiny of the rupee is to depreciate in the short run more and more and more because not only are we not productive, we have created a complete shit show with our national currency. Everybody’s property. We have taken a lot of foreign debt because the bank’s Hold to Maturity book is untouchable because of its unrealised losses that one would shudder to even look at. We will need to buy foreign currency at some point in the future to pay those loans back and to do that we will devaluate the rupee through our central bank buying a lot of dollars to pay those loans back. That is not everything, the penultimate disrespect is that, whilst the key rate is being kept at 4.50% so that banks can rip you off, on your variable interest rate loans, the Kingdom of Mauritius has already loosened monetary policy since July 2023. It has stopped issuing 7-day t-bills at 4.50% because it cannot afford to pay the interest. It’s too much for your Kingdom, given it is already bankrupt. But it’s okay to let banks eat away at your salary and keep the key rate at 4.50% because it is our destiny buddy. All of this is our destiny. People wonder why young and talented people are leaving this country. It is because they know, and they have acknowledged reality as it is and left because there was no future here. They knew what their fate was. We are all the ultimate suckers in all of this because ironically in the biggest twist of fate, our Kingdom today is the one running a Ponzi scheme. It is removing money from one place to pay someone else whilst not paying someone else. Guess who is not getting paid. It is us, the peasants, the ultimate suckers of the Kingdom of Mauritius because such is our fate. We must be happy to have such a kind and good king do we not?\nWhat will you do? Will you accept the fate your parents accepted for 56 years? This arrogance and this touper does not come around in a few months. It has always been this horrible. No one pointed it out, that is all. This is the point where I ask you the famous existential crisis question. Why the fuck do you exist? Do you exist to be a slave to the Kingdom of Mauritius? I have broken all the indoctrination now. I cannot do anything more for you. IT IS TIME TO CHOOSE A SIDE. I have always thought that Prince Zuko’s journey was one of the most inspiring journeys that has ever been written. Prince Zuko went from being an indoctrinated and brainwashed kid to a young adult who can think and act on his own. May Prince Zuko guide you here and here.\n\nTime to stand up and write your own destiny or be a slave that gets bullied for the rest of your life like your parents did for 56 years and forever thus hold your peace.",

Of how a King and his closed circle using fake statistics, heavy financial repression and all of the state companies’ free cashflow, bankrupting every single one of them in the process, was still unable to compensate for their unfathomable incompetence.\n\n\nJun 3, 2024\n\n\n\n\nYuuki \n\n\nGod’s Plan\n\n\nThis paper espouses the view that everything is determined by god and that our country could not accommodate a real democracy for the past 56 years because it wasn’t ready. But that period is over, through the grace of God, because education has crossed the required threshold now. After 56 long years, our Kingdom will finally get to be a Republic that belongs equally to each citizen. Where everybody will finally have defacto access to the same rights and the same opportunities.\n\n\nMar 12, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
