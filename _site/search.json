    "text": "The situation of the Republic of Mauritius has been catastrophic for a lot of years now. I wish it was possible for me to explain all of this to you without mathematics. But it is not possible, because it would be my words against the current government’s lies. That is a bad standard to set. It would basically be me telling you to believe my propaganda, versus the government’s propaganda. Here is the thing, I should not have to convince you. There is no need for any propaganda of any kind. I should not have to convince you that gravity exists. If you drop something, you can observe that it will fall down according to the laws of classical mechanics. Just like physics, economics is a deterministic field of study. It has its laws too. It is just not explicitly taught that way because it is a social science. I am going to teach you a simple way to think about macroeconomics in this paper that will help you understand not only the economy of the Republic of Mauritius but any economy in the world. It is slightly hard, if you do not know calculus. That does not mean, you should just give up. Hit a friend up. Tell them to teach you. Do not be ashamed of not understanding this. This is not easy to understand. I am doing what no politician has ever done with you, treat you with respect. You the young people, who understand this, I need you to do your part too. Explain what is in this paper, to people around you who cannot understand it. You need to embrace that, I cannot do everything. You have a very important part to play in all of this if you are educated enough. If you want a country where you could easily be the richest because you know inside you, that you have what it takes. If you want to be the president one day. You have to play your part now to make it possible for you and your own kids tomorrow.\nIf you understand this paper, you will finally understand that all the economic statistics of the Republic of Mauritius are wildly fake these days. We are on the brink of total collapse more than ever. All it takes, is capital flight from GBC deposits. Even something as small as, one-two billion dollar worth of deposits being claimed would force banks to buy a lot foreign currency breaking the exchange rate, to honor their liabilities. In some cases, some would be forced to sell assets by marking them to market, in the process hurting their books and in all likelihood breaking the banking system as a whole which is not solid at all. You see, these days, Mauritius is just bankrupt. It has been for a long time. But that is the problem with invented governments that has a monopoly over their own currency. They cannot go bankrupt or declare bankruptcy. Because government can always invent an excuse and print money via the central bank. Around 150 billion rupees has been printed solely via bullshit excuses to make up for the fact that the country is broke. Had they not printed that money, a revolution would have already ensued. But they made the situation so much worse, by printing so much money, allowing so much inflation just to save their necks. You have to understand that. You had to pay a price. You had to starve, so they could live another day. Just so they may continue to steal, just so they could keep a noose tied around your necks. Just so they could keep you enslaved. That is not a bad dream I am inventing. That is reality of the situation. Foreign currency access today is only allowed to those who are in the good favors of government. It is the most discriminatory the country has ever been since its independence. There are two kinds of people today in the Republic of Mauritius. The kind who gets unlimited access to foreign currency and the kind that has to beg, to be able to send their children money. The worst of it is that faced with this a lot of conglomerates have simply, stopped selling their foreign currencies. Honestly, I cannot blame them. I would not either. I would use swaps too. Its just a good business decision. If you let go of your FCY, you would be a sitting duck as a business. You need to be liquid enough and government is not. You let go, of your FCY, its gone forever.\nNow, this discrimination was always true of domestic currency and still is. There are people in the Republic of Mauritius that always had unlimited access to money and generally at a reduced cost. You can use any word you want but crony is a good word. A crony can be anybody, so we should define the term. A crony is anybody who gets gets their cost of capital subsidised by the government, sometimes below the risk free rate. Now there is a peculiarity with crimes, in that most of them are not recognized as crimes and you cannot do anything about that. I cannot do anything about the free capital that government gave for 56 years. They are not crimes. They are policies, when well orchestrated. Policies that were designed to bleed you as much as possible, to please their cronies and fill their own pockets with any bribe they could get for this favor. Likewise, and it can be cruel to hear this, but politicians never explicitly steal public money. No good politician ever steals public money. Technically they spend public money which will cleverly find its way back to them. Nevertheless among all of these crimes, sometimes are dumbducks who do dumb shit like the empty buildings the government rents, non existent buildings it has paid for in advance, the useless buildings it bought, and the advanced payments it has so frequently given people to get nothing in return. These are examples of public welfare offenses under a fair penal code. You cannot just play with public money as if it is your own god damn money. You must be smart when stealing public money. This current government was not. Well, I guess you do not need to be right now in Mauritius, given laws have become useless. ICAC? More like ICUCK. It is a crazy country we live in. With all the aiding, abetting and obstruction of justice that happens daily. Anyway, all of these are public offenses which are strict liability offenses. So, mens rea will not save anbody. There is no need to worry about the criminals. US law is not the flimsy Mauritian law you have lived with for 56 years. So, if no one told you yet, you need to realise the laws in this country suck. They had to so people could do whatever the fuck they wanted for 56 years with your money. Anyway, to sum up, no country, that treats its citizens, with such discrimination can be doing well. Let us understand all of this with some basic mathematics.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "GENERAL PURPOSE OF THE WEBSITE\n\n\nI never told anyone this in my entire life because it is an embarassing secret, but my dream as a kid was weird. I wanted to become the President of the United States to make a utopic world real. I was a dumb kid back then, but I understood the position of the US in the world somehow. Eventually, I got the internet and googled it and that was when my dreams got shattered. You had to be a natural born citizen of the US to be President. Today, I know world peace is not in the books for human beings. Still, my dream stayed the same. I reckoned, this is even better, given I was born here. Why do I not try to make the country I was born in, a true place of peace? That was entirely possible. To make this country a real paradise, unlike the hell it actually is. The core of Africa and not the periphery it currently is. Over time, as I grew up though, this idealism slowly waned as I was confronted with the amount of quackery that is prevalent in the Republic of Mauritius, in all sectors, all wakes of life, all households, from the richest to the poorest. We kind of suck, even though I will not deny that there are a lot of very competent people in Mauritius. When compared to the world though, even you and me the competent ones, we undeniably suck. I say this very humbly of course. I may be intelligent in the Republic of Mauritius but to the world, I am most average. Still, the world is fairer out there than it is in here. Which can only mean it might be time for me to get out there to be able to make a name for myself without having to suck some politician’s dick. I want to be my own person more than anything. You feel me?\nStill, there is this growing pit in my stomach. You are leaving your own behind, my mind screams at me. What will they do without you? You know, no one gives a single fuck about them. Of course, I would be leaving my family behind if I left. But my family will do just fine without me. You see, the real reason my mind screams at me and makes me feel guilty everytime I think of leaving this prison behind, is you the population of Mauritius, because I would be leaving you behind to rot in this hell by doing so. I would be letting these dumbasses take advantage of you. So, let me make things clear and keep it 100 with you. This is not a heroic endeavor. I want to be the head of state of the Republic of Mauritius, because I know that I can make this country reach advanced economy status before I die. At the same time, I know it is a pipe dream unless things drastically change. This anonymous website will not only allow for that change to be possible. I got the inspiration from reading the original federalist and antifederalist papers..^[For Federalist papers go [here] It will most importantly ease my conscience because after this, I will not feel guilty anymore. This is me giving it my all to help my country. If my all is not enough, then I will just move on. No harm, no foul.\nHowever, if you can finally see just how much you got played for 56 years, maybe that anger can change things. The realisation that the source of all your suffering was the only thing you believed in your entire life, which is communalism and race voting could finally be the nail in the coffin that pushes you to accept that communalism voting has never ever benefited you, the general population. It benefitted a very small group of people for 56 years. Yes, these people are billionaires today. But they only are because they stole the rewards of your sweat and your parent’s sweat for 56 long years. If you can accept reality as it is, then a new dawn will be upon us. A new chapter in the history of the Republic of Mauritius.\n\nWhere together we will bid adieu, to the Monarchy of Mauritius forever and get true independence after 56 years."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Like most of you, I have lived my entire life in the Republic of Mauritius. Over the years though, there are some disturbing things that I have found out, about this country we all call home. The elites in the private sector and the public sector are legitimately the dumbest people I have ever seen in my life. They rely on the rest of the population as their crutch, to make up for their incredible amount of incompetence. That has led the Republic of Mauritius to be a country of mediocrity, that after 56 years of independence is completely stuck because these dumbducks are holding it back. The country we live in is not progressing anymore. It has not progressed at all for years. This country’s elites are so incompetent, that the government is willingly encouraging people to leave their own homes, by making their lives harder and facilitating more imports of foreign workers in every sector, because they are much easier to exploit. It is akin to hitting two birds with one stone, given they also push people, who in all likelihood would not vote for them. Everybody knows that the imported labor is underpaid and overworked. Do you understand, how unkind these people at the top are? They would do it to you too, if labor laws were not here to protect you. They are conspiring with the government literally to push you away from your home. From your place of birth because they are too incompetent. So with you, they change tunes. They will gaslight you, and scream you are lazy, they will demean you, and scream that you are apparently a bum — When the bitter truth is that they cannot afford to pay you a decent living wage because their costs would increase too much and they would go bankrupt. Because of their own incompetence, not yours. They need slaves to compensate for their incompetence. To exploit. These are horrible people. These people will never stop. This has been going on for 56 years and it will go on for 56 more unless you stand up.\nIt’s not like this country lacks competence today. There are very competent people waiting on the sidelines, to be able to get the opportunity to help their country. You, the young people of the Republic of Mauritius, who eagerly await for someone to recognize your talent and reward you for your true worth. You need to accept that you need someone competent to be able to do that. That is never going to happen, in the current Mauritius. Unfortunately, kindness, in and of itself does not actually exist. What exists is competence. You can only be as kind as you are competent in this world. A dumbduck, on the other hand, cannot be kind. We are in a very fucked up situation to be honest, which is why I have in the end taken it upon myself to do something about it. I deserve better too. You have a country filled with undeserving, incompetent people hogging all its wealth and bullying the rest of the population. These people have bankrupted the country repeatedly over the past 56 years. This will end very badly going forward, if someone does not responsibly step in and end this degeneracy once and for all. I am doing the dumbducks a favor here. Saving them from their own stupidity. This country we live in, let us be real here is completely ruined financially. If someone does not do anything, this can only end into a revolution the longer this drags on like in Sri Lanka.\nAt this point, I know too much to turn a blind eye. I am competent enough you see, to not need anybody currently in either the private sector or the public sector. You see, I am interested, in a Mauritius that does massive semiconductors manufacturing. Cars manufacturing. Electronics manufacturing. In letting a multinational like Intercontinental Exchange, open a clearing house here called ICE Africa, to establish Mauritius as the core of Africa in Finance. I am interested, in a Mauritius whose population is closer to ~6-8 million rather than the 1.3 million it currently is. I am not interested in the periphery Mauritius, that you come to, when you need to set up some funds here, to evade taxes or launder some dollars that you steal from your people’s home country as a statesman. In the periphery Mauritius you come to do textiles manufacturing. I am simply not interested in menial labor intensive manufacturing which is what we currently do. I am simply not interested in the Mauritius that exists today. It is disgusting. It is literal hell. All it does is exploit, exploit, exploit. It is a prison. It is all it claims not to be. I am not interested in the dumbducks or their future, wealth or prosperity. I could not give less of a fuck about protecting their interests. I am interested in you, the young people. The unused talent of this country. The STEM and non-STEM majors. I am interested in you, the future of the Republic of Mauritius. Because I cannot do this alone. I need you, the competent people to take a stand. Together, we can rebuild this country.\nBut you must understand, the very conundrum that this poses for the dumbducks. You see while the dumbducks are a rare breed, because there is so few of them. They control a large part of the country. A few families control more than 50% of the entire economy of the Kingdom of Mauritius. Thing is, this country is not the free market it so likes to claim. This country is tailor made for a group people. So tailor-made, that the government had to literally destroy a conglomerate called British American Investment, to prevent it from becoming the leading conglomerate of the Republic of Mauritius. The only smart duck in town that was killed off. This is how tailor-made this country is. You are really in a fancy prison, if you are educated enough to see through the facade, that the dumbducks have set up. The majority of the people in politics in this country are families and related. Almost all of them have never brought anything to the table besides history, that is their father’s or mother’s name or the fact that they were related. They practice a modern form of inbreeding to keep their inner circle small because only two political parties have sway in the country. They both use race to do politics. Really, when you look at it objectively, Mauritius is just the Europe of the 1780’s-1800’s. It is an abomination that must end. And It will end. What has started here, signals the end of the monarchy of mauritius. Where, all the laws, are carefully drafted so that the chosen elites have zero competitors and enjoy monopolies. Trademark laws or what is known as patent exhaustion are carefully made so, you cannot be a competitor to someone representing a brand from abroad. How is this a free market? It is not. It is just one of the many many lies the country perpetuates. Lots of crazy propaganda in this country, one, I remember, that was popular when I was young – is that it is the only country in the world where education and health were free. Your parents believed that lie. Even my parents believed that lie. But that is all it ever was. Lies. We call propaganda. Propaganda exists to manipulate uneducated people. To make obedient sheep. Slaves. Truth is, most countries have socialist policies. All this country has ever really done is copy laws from other countries. Truth is parallel imports would have done much more for you than free healthcare ever did.\nThe truth is they lie, and that is all they do. They are good at it. That is the only thing they excel at. I guess stealing public money is another thing most of them excel at. They make shit up to seem competent. They will pay a shit ton of money to get into a university, earn a piece of paper to fake their competence. But cannot even use an excel sheet. They are so insecure that they will abuse their authority over the police to bully you if you ever are a threat to them. Things are so bad that these days, some outright fake the fact that they do not even have the qualifications they claim. They fake the paper altogether rather than just faking their competence. That is how incompetent our country has become after 56 years. Unfortunately, because our parents were not given the chance to have the education we have been offered, they bought these lies for 56 years. They could not see through these phonies. They thought, that these people were the best of the country. That they are competent. A lot of people actually believe that. That some politicians have saved our country. That they are the reason Mauritius progressed. You cannot hold it against your parents, to have been sucked in communalism propaganda. You cannot even hold it against you if you have been sucked in communalism propaganda for that matter. This is your chance to change though. Unlike your parents who are probably too far gone. To their credit, everybody was sucked in from that generation. They got sucked in because they could not know better. They were denied an education. This was their education. To be racist. They were indoctrinated, by the politics of the Republic of Mauritius for 56 years. Most old people in the Republic of Mauritius are extremely racist. You should however never hold it against them. They did not choose to be racist. They were forced to be racists. We would all be racists too, had we been given the same education our parents and grandparents were given which was not one. It was a school of propaganda. Of castes. Of religious hate. Of sowing the seeds of discord and violence. Of encouraging discrimination. It is how disgusting, the politics of that generation was and still is to this day. Their definition of what democracy is, is therefore colored by all that indoctrination. Just like the definition of democracy to most North Koreans is to have a supreme leader that controls everything, because they are indoctinated to believe that.\nFor all those reasons, it is unlikely that your parents would understand any of this. Because they are victims, in all of this, who have been abused by politics for 56 years and they do not even know it. They do not have the required education to be able to process all of this. They cannot understand that, they have been lied to, played with, by religion for 56 long years while the resources of the country were mismanaged by all the governments. Just like they cannot understand that the government is fooling them by using printed central bank money to increase their pension which will only increase the cost of living and make their life harder, not easier. But it seems destiny had other plans for you. I want to be very clear. Yes, the current government will go down as the worst in the history of the country but other governments stole just as much by funneling public money into their close circle’s bank accounts by being intermediaries rather than service providers on all tenders that the government puts out. Do not be stupid, by thinking there was a ‘’good government’’. Good governments, do not exist. That is why laws exist. Good laws are what the Republic of Mauritius needs. Nobody has done anything though for 56 long years, because they all enjoyed stealing the resources of the country when it was their turn at bat. Everybody has stolen money. You live in a country where the top companies have continuously gone bust for over 56 years, only to be given your hard-earned money so they can do it all over again. That is the law of the Republic of Mauritius. In it, you are a prisoner if you are not born, in some select families. If you do not somehow suck up, to the right person, suck some dick if you are extremely unlucky, your ambitions will always have ceilings. Competence is irrelevant in this country. Because dumbducks do not have it. And they set the rules. So, to you the people of competence. You have to change the game. That is the only option.",

That is not a bad dream I am inventing. That is reality of the situation. Foreign currency access today is only allowed to those who are in the good favors of government. It is the most discriminatory the country has ever been since its independence. There are two kinds of people today in the Republic of Mauritius. The kind who gets unlimited access to foreign currency and the kind that has to beg, to be able to send their children money. The worst of it is that faced with this a lot of conglomerates have simply, stopped selling their foreign currencies. Honestly, I cannot blame them. I would not either. I would use swaps too. Its just a good business decision. If you let go of your FCY, you would be a sitting duck as a business. You need to be liquid enough and government is not. You let go, of your FCY, its gone forever.\nNow, this discrimination was always true of domestic currency and still is. There are people in the Republic of Mauritius that always had unlimited access to money and generally at a reduced cost. You can use any word you want but crony is a good word. A crony can be anybody, so we should define the term. A crony is anybody who gets gets their cost of capital subsidised by the government, sometimes below the risk free rate. Now there is a peculiarity with crimes, in that most of them are not recognized as crimes and you cannot do anything about that. I cannot do anything about the free capital that government gave for 56 years. They are not crimes. They are policies, when well orchestrated. Policies that were designed to bleed you as much as possible, to please their cronies and fill their own pockets with any bribe they could get for this favor. Likewise, and it can be cruel to hear this, but politicians never explicitly steal public money. No good politician ever steals public money. Technically they spend public money which will cleverly find its way back to them. Nevertheless among all of these crimes, sometimes are dumbducks who do dumb shit like the empty buildings the government rents, non existent buildings it has paid for in advance, the useless buildings it bought, and the advanced payments it has so frequently given people to get nothing in return. These are examples of public welfare offenses under a fair penal code. You cannot just play with public money as if it is your own god damn money. You must be smart when stealing public money. This current government was not. Well, I guess you do not need to be right now in Mauritius, given laws have become useless. ICAC? More like ICUCK. It is a crazy country we live in. With all the aiding, abetting and obstruction of justice that happens daily. Anyway, all of these are public offenses which are strict liability offenses. So, mens rea will not save anbody. There is no need to worry about the criminals. US law is not the flimsy Mauritian law you have lived with for 56 years. So, if no one told you yet, you need to realise the laws in this country suck. They had to so people could do whatever the fuck they wanted for 56 years with your money. Anyway, to sum up, no country, that treats its citizens, with such discrimination can be doing well. Let us understand all of this with some basic mathematics.",

    "text": "Microdynamics\nConsider real output in a closed economy.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\\label{eq-a}\ny(c,s) = c_{r} + s_{r} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad s = i\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn a closed economy there are only two things, consumption \\(c\\) and savings \\(s\\). Because of that fact, savings also equals investment when considering a closed economy. Now in macroeconomics, there are two type of statistics. One that is called a real statistic where inflation is stripped off and another one where inflation is not stripped off, that is called a nominal statistic. These two statistics are always related to each other, at all times. The challenge is to understand, how they are related objectively, so that even if the Republic of Mauritius was faking all of its statistics (which it is doing, these days), it would ultimately not matter, because you would not need to rely on any statistic anymore. You would rather have an understanding of how an economy works. You would never need to read an opinion about the economy every again in this life. You would always know everything about any economy. Now, the first step in doing that is to understand how nominal output and real output are related. Consider writing \\((1)\\) in different real terms.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{2}\\label{eq-b}\ny(c,s) = c_{r} + s_{r} \\Longleftrightarrow y(p(c,s)) = \\frac{c_{n}+s_{n}}{p_{\\text{deflator}}} \\Longleftrightarrow y(k(c,s)) = \\frac{c_{n}+s_{n}}{k}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAs you can see these equations are related by the fact that, they all represent real output, but we do not work with real output in the real world, because governments need a get out of jail free card through money printing. We work with nominal output, because economics is ultimately a ponzi scheme based on population growth, where you pay back debt with a little growth and with money being less valuable over time, which is a process that is called inflation. Do not panic, this is true, well known and easy to derive. We will much further down. You see, the belief that government exists to protect your interests for example is a naive and dumb interpretation of human nature. It is very hard to believe with all the fluff, that government throws at you. But you have to remember, governments exists because it is the most elegant and non controversial way to hold power over the resources of a country, . All you need is a bad constitution and bad laws for the nightmare to begin. These are both things, the Republic of Mauritius has had for 56 years. Which is why it has never progressed and why most countries do not. You are getting played buddy, there is no democracy, no fairness. Just you, the slave who is too afraid to stand up to the bullies of this country. The real question is do you want this to change? Then you need to force yourself to learn. You need to understand the world as it is. Now, back to business, why is it important to understand how real and nominal output works ?\nIt is important, because one affects the other. There are causal relationships here. Cause and effect relationships, which means that, \\(p_{\\text{deflator}}\\) which here represents either the GDP deflator or the consumer price index (CPI) and \\(k\\) which here represents the exchange rate, can give you useful information about any economy at any time. You do not need to know real output exactly, you can infer everything from a robust understanding of how the exchange rates, price indexes and output are objectively related. Economics is not magic. These are simple rules every economy out there will always respect. Meaning these are three ways to be looking at the same thing objectively, because all these three equations represent the same thing \\(y\\) which is real output. So this logically means that \\((2)\\) is equivalent to (3).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{3}\\label{eq-c}\n\\text{Real Output} \\Longleftrightarrow \\text{Real Output} \\Longleftrightarrow  \\text{Real Output}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSo even if, any government like the current republic of mauritius fakes all its statistics, it cannot fake how economics works deterministically. If you can understand that, then you are good to go. The biggest barrier to understanding this is going to be basic calculus. It is unlikely that I would be able to teach you calculus here if you do not know it. This is the point, where you ask a friend to teach you calculus by explaining the things here. Do not be ashamed, to ask. So the first thing we have to do is understand the causal relationships between\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}= \\dfrac{dy}{dp} \\dfrac{dp}{ds} = \\dfrac{dy}{dk} \\dfrac{dk}{ds} = Productivity\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{dc}= \\dfrac{dy}{dp} \\dfrac{dp}{dc} = \\dfrac{dy}{dk} \\dfrac{dk}{dc} = Inflation\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSo from these two equations, the first causal relationship that we find is that between productivity and inflation. Productivity is the absence of inflation. An increase in inflation will always be met by decreases in productivity. Now why is that true? To understand that we need to understand the causal relation between exchange rates, prices and real output. We can understand that by defining the total differential of both price \\(p(c(t),s(t))\\) and exchange rate \\(k(c(t),s(t))\\) over time to be.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{4}\\label{eq-d}\n\\dfrac{dp}{dt}= \\dfrac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{c}} \\dfrac{dc}{dt} + \\dfrac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{s}} \\dfrac{ds}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{5}\n\\dfrac{dk}{dt}= \\dfrac{\\partial{k}}{\\partial{c}} \\dfrac{dc}{dt} + \\dfrac{\\partial{k}}{\\partial{s}} \\dfrac{ds}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThese definitions have implications, namely that if\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&gt;0= k \\downarrow \\;\\; p \\downarrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&lt;0= k \\uparrow \\;\\; p \\uparrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis is where we are confronted with the first problem of economics. Equation \\((4)\\) can be tampered with and is tampered with arbitrarily everywhere in the world. Truth is, everybody likes inflation to be low because every government wants to be re-elected, so there is an inherent bias towards calibrating the index you are using to calculate inflation, with weights that favors, low inflation by design. A slightly different version of (4) is generally estimated using a Laspayes or Paasche index to obtain inflation growth rates as.\n\\[\\frac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}}\\]\nThis paper by the US bureau of labour statistics gives a good breakdown of how (4) is estimated. Now, this is not what the Republic of Mauritius has been doing. This is what most advanced economies have been doing, understating the impact of inflation but they do not hide it. All of them have food, shelter and energy components of inflation. Our country has outright been misreporting inflation and a simple proof of this is that there are other price indexes that they did not bother to fake, like the leading indicator of inflation itself. The Producer Price Index. Which changed \\(50\\%\\) from Jan 2020 to April 2024. Now, companies do not just pass costs on to you, they need to also have a decent profit margin because they like profits, and they need to pass on the cost of higher employment to you. There are ample reasons why if the PPI is \\(50\\%\\) then the CPI has got to be a lot higher. What we can say though is that inflation since Jan 2020 to April 2024 is at minimum greater than \\(50\\%\\). I have no idea, how high inflation really has been. But you can make an educated guess. You can come to one with some principles. Notably, that government is bankrupt so it cannot give you anything. So, anything it gives will always fall short of completely restoring your purchasing power. So if we look at the evolution of the minimum wage, you should technically be better off right now, by A LOT. Are you really better off ? No, you are struggling, everybody is struggling, atleast in the middle class because the CPI is completely useless and fake. Which is why there are allowances on top of the minimum wage so the government can try to win elections. All of these things allows us to make an educated guess. Which is that inflation is between \\(90\\%-100\\%\\) for the CPI index for the last four years. Because they gave you that much. They must have taken more, given the country is broke and not in a position to be able to give you anything. We have been living on central bank money for four years now. Since November 2019.\n\n\nPRICE INDEXES VS MINIMUM WAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nProducer Price Index\nConsumer Price Index\nMinimum Wage\nMinimum Wage with Allocations\n\n\n\n\nJan-2020\n103.2\n80.7\n9,700\n10,200\n\n\nApr-2024\n153.7\n103.24\n17,000\n20,000\n\n\nChange\n52%\n27%\n75%\n96%\n\n\n\n\nSo if you are following and understanding this writing, your question should now be, so then what is causal relationship between Equation (4) and (5). Who leads, and what is the cause and effect ? (4) and (5) are intimately related through the fact that inflation is always the leading operator which signals the direction that the exchange rate will be moving in, all other things remaining equal (interest rates). So this simplifies things, because we can now focus on how inflation works between countries to regulate their exchange rates. The first important thing is the Real Exchange Rate between two currencies.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{6}\nRER_{t}= k_{t} \\cdot \\cfrac{p_{t}}{p^{*}_{t}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis is very simple. An increasing RER means your currency is getting overvalued. Overvalued means inflation in your country is higher than inflation in the other country. Which means your goods and services are getting too expensive. So two things can happen. External demand of the goods and services that your country produces will fall if prices rise too much. Second, because goods are cheaper abroad, businesses will import as much as they can, because they can resell higher on the domestic market with a slight markup. This has been the business model of the country for the past fifteen years. We are not a productive country anymore. We have not been getting, any huge increases in external demand for practically ten years now. External demand has basically been the same. What we have been getting is massive inflows of foreign currency from the global business sector, that has allowed the rupee to stay massively overvalued. Which has allowed us to live beyond our means, for more than practically fifteen years now. But, all good things must come to an end. We cannot handle it anymore. The rupee is way too overvalued these days. It can only be overvalued because inflation is a lot more than the measly \\(27\\%\\) you are shown. The only thing reliable in an economy is permanent production which gives permanent inflows of funds. We do not have that unfortunately. We have not done anything for now like 25 years besides non tradables development. Literally. That is why there is no future today left.\nLet us look at the other side now. A decreasing RER means your currency is undervalued. Undervalued means inflation in your country is lower than inflation in the other country. Which means your goods and services are really cheap. Which increases the demand for the goods and services that your country produces. This is not the situation of the Republic of Mauritius. But it is the situation of Japan. But you will have to go look at that by yourself. Think of it as a good exercise for yourself to mentally test whether you actually understood anything from this paper. Find out what the effect, of the Yen depreciation has been for Japan. Has it increased its exports of goods and services ? Why has that happened ? What is the microeconomic rationale ?\n\\[\\cfrac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}}&gt;\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}_{t}}{p_{t}} =\\; \\uparrow RER \\quad \\cfrac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}}&lt;\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}_{t}}{p_{t}} =\\;  \\downarrow RER\\]\nThe mechanics of the RER are fairly straight forward, you take yearly percentage changes in any price indicator for any two currencies you are trying to measure. If domestic prices \\(p_{t}\\) have increased more than foreign prices \\(p^{*}_{t}\\), then the RER increases and your currency goes in the direction of overvaluation. If however, foreign prices \\(p^{*}_{t}\\) is what has increased more than domestic prices, then the RER decreases and your currency goes in the direction of undervaluation. You might ask then so how does the RER adjust itself to go back to its equilibrium value ? \\(k\\) moves up or down. Exchange rate movements is what stablises the RER over time. So while it is impossible to find the unknown function to (5), we can actually use (4) to approximate a linear equation although (7) can never be exact (deterministic) because there is no way to find out what the exact annual change in prices truly is.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{7}\n\\dot{k}_{t+1} = k_{t} \\cdot RER_{t}(\\cfrac{\\dot{p}}{p}-\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}}{p^{*}})_{t}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nLet us now do examples then and apply this thing, to show how easy it is to estimate the actual inflation that the country has been going through. We can also estimate it this way.\n\n\n  \n  Track all markets on TradingView\n  \n  \n\n\nTo be able to estimate actual inflation using this method, you must first understand why it works. Because countries can trade with each other, that means arbitrage (buying cheap from a country reselling high domestically), will always happen to bring prices of goods between countries to equilibrium. Not the price of services though. A hair cut cannot be traded and will always cost more abroad compared to Mauritius if you are using advanced economies as comparison standards. So to use this method called Relative Purchasing Power Parity, the first thing you must do, is pick a highly tradable good, that is sold worlwide and in huge quantities so that you can assume that there is always arbitrage going on for this good so that, its prices are heading for equilibrium, at the very least. Such a good, is the IPhone.\nFrom the current price of the rupee to the dollar, we can assume that there has been atleast a difference of inflation amounting to the order of \\(32\\%\\) judging from the graph between the United States and Mauritius. That right off the bat is more than the again measly \\(27\\%\\) you are being shown which is clearly Bullshit. So the US had a CPI reading of \\(314\\) in May and going back to Jan 2020, it had a reading of \\(258\\). Added to our 32% that gives us an inflation of 53%.\n\n\nShow the code\ndifference_usd_mur = 0.32\nexcess = (314-258)/258 \npartial_cpi_mur = (excess + difference_usd_mur) * 100\n\nprint(partial_cpi_mur)\n\n\n53.70542635658915\n\n\nSo now we can calculate the remaining inflation that the country has gone through based on how overvalued the currency is. That is to say, we can use the RER to find out the remaining inflation that Mauritius went through in the past four years. So remember the equation is the following.\n\\[ RER_{t} = MURUSD_{t} \\cdot \\frac{p_{Iphone}^{MUR}}{p_{Iphone}^{USD}}  \\]\n\n\nShow the code\nmur_price_iphone = 105999\nusd_price_iphone = 1599\nmur_usd = 1/46.69\n\nrer = (mur_usd * mur_price_iphone)/usd_price_iphone\novervaluation = (rer - 1) * 100\ntotal_inflation = partial_cpi_mur + overvaluation\n\nprint(overvaluation)\nprint(total_inflation)\n\n\n41.9807383898509\n95.68616474644006\n\n\nWould you look at that, this can explain the rationale behind the minimum wage increases. If inflation is around 96%, then yes the rise in minimum wages and allocations makes total sense. Because the country has not been progressing so, it cannot give you anything. It can lie and say it is giving you everything, that it has been doing for 56 years now. But the best government can do is restore some purchasing power, that inflation has eroded. Not all your purchasing power though and certainly not, give you additional purchasing power. Now, what about the ZAR. Why is it that the Rand and the Rupee have barely moved against each other? Why is this pair so stable? What do they have in common might we ask that is preventing any big swing in the exchange rates? Indeed, South Africa, fakes their inflation too. Lots of countries do, lots of countries have revolutions coming at some point. You need to accept that if you seriously want to understand the world you live in. South Africa, has had as high inflation as Mauritius in the past four years.\nNow, you should really master what you have learned here. Then move on to the next portion. The next portion uses this portion. It connects to it.",

    "text": "Appealing The Heavens\nNow here is the thing, either you put an end to the bullying, via elections before it’s too late. Or we will eventually go into a revolution at some point in the future. It is as simple as that. The country has been bankrupt for a long time now. No political party coming into power will change that fact. There is no magic ingredient. To stop this, you need to acknowledge this does not work. What has been done for 56 years never worked. That is a hard and cold fact. Not an opinion. Repeatedly, the country went bust, which is why there were devaluations each time, like right now. The country went bust because state resources went into the bank accounts of politicians and their closed circles. Who simply stole your tax money and increased your suffering. Every time they stole, they diluted the real wealth of the country. Your wealth had to decrease, for theirs to increase. You do not have much wealth left today. Do you understand, why all revolutions happen? People do not simply wake up wanting to kill their state leaders. It is years of suffering that has been bottled up that explodes.\nWhich is why, I need you to understand what you are getting yourself into right now. This is a fight for freedom. For liberty, to end the opression of the monarchy of Mauritius once and for all. What is happening in Mauritius is not an isolated event. It is happening all over the world. This is what always happens. Human beings are piece of shits. It is human nature. Some are competent piece of shits. Some are incompetent piece of shits. I am a competent piece of shit. You are a competent piece of shit too. They are not. I am keeping things a 100 with you. Do you think the United States has no corruption? Every country has A LOT of corruption. It is just how things are. It is sad certainly. But it is a cold truth that speaks of human nature. The country that progresses though, has competent people in the private sector to compensate for their dumbducks, in the public sector and they have laws that work. You are allowed to steal, but if you get caught stealing, tough luck. You played and lost. You go to prison. We have nothing. No working laws. We have dumbducks in both sectors. Today, Mauritius finds itself in a situation where it is actually riskfree to steal given nothing will happen given there is no justice anymore. Nothing works. There is nothing left in this country. It is possibly the worst banana republic on earth. Everything is controlled by the Prime Minister, like a King once had control in Europe. That is why the country is sliding at a much faster pace than before. People steal every day now.\nSo remember, if you are in, this is our fight, not our parent’s fight. Your parents cannot understand. Mine cannot either. You might think, well that is weird. But it is exactly how revolutions happen. People who are not indoctrinated or who are very educated are the people who participate in it. That means young and older educated people. American Revolutionaries were from these two groups joining forces alone. Have you ever read the United States Declaration of Independence?. You really should. You will see all the similarities that the then Great Britain had with the current Kingdom of Mauritius. I need you to understand and accept that you live in a country with zero democracy. With a King, who is unleashing his tyranny and needs to be stopped at all costs. I will include the most important part of it below just in case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Declaration of Independence\n\n\n\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\n\n\nYou see, appealing the heavens is a serious thing. John Locke used it a metaphor to explain how every human being has the right of revolution whenever they are denied their natural rights which are life, liberty and their pursuit of happiness by their ruler or state. You are being denied those things heavily in Mauiritus today as I will be showing you in other articles. Those rights are natural rights, in that they supersede any man made law. As for the literal meaning of appealing the heavens, the last passage of the declaration expounds what it means. It means to let god decide who is worthy of winning. The United States appealed to a higher power in their declaration telling god, you choose the winner buddy. We think what great britain is doing is wrong and we are prepared to bet our lives on it to fight for our life, liberty and our pursuit of happiness. The United States never wanted to go that far, they were forced to go that far by Britain denying them their Independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Declaration of Independence\n\n\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\n\n\nThe truth is this country was never fought for, not in 1968, not ever. The UK was royally fucked, when they lost India. They had no more bodies to send to die in colonies to further their oppression. After the Algerian war, it was simply a bad political choice to hold on to colonies, unless you had non-voting bodies to throw at them. You would lose elections which is why, the UK let go as did France of its colonies. Now, you want to thank someone. Thank all the people, who bravely fought and died for your freedom in the Algerian revolution, because they are the real cause, the entire African continent, finally got liberated. That is a fact buddy. Again not an opinion. Simple cause and effect. All our representatives ensured is that we would one day become a banana republic. That this day would come. That is a bad way to ensure democracy if you ask me. Especially when the original way of handling elections, which the British proposed included proportional representation. That would have done more than anyone has ever for the past 56 years, to ensure democracy in this country, but we did not want democracy, so we forced first past the post on a country of uneducated people and a pseudo proportional representation based on raciality. To make race and communalism the game for 56 years. ON PURPOSE. They simply did not give a fuck about you then and neither do they now. They got what they wanted. Power and access to the state’s resources for 56 years. What do you want? Anybody ever ask you that in 56 years?\nI write this anonymously for a simple purpose. I wish to end this here. Not with war, not with a revolution. It should be fairly obvious to you by now, that the chances of me coming out is very slim. I would die, let us be honest with ourselves. Given the amount of unexplained deaths and the hesitancy to make any serious inquiry, as to the real cause of the deaths of all those people either affiliated with government, politics, or public procurement. I think, we all know who did it. I am a complete nobody and that is fine with me for now atleast. It is why I can afford to be so real with you. The magic of the internet, and anonymity over it. I will vote the labour party in the coming elections and if you wish to show support of me, I hope you will vote the labour party as well. I know, the labour party is not great. I get that even the labour party steals. I get that the labour party has not been very different from the other party who ruled this country. I cannot do anything about the past of the labour party, nor do I wish to destroy the heritage of this country. I think our country has a great heritage. Perfection is not real. The horror which the politicians hide from you as well as the good which they will always exacerbate because they are talking of their fathers’ (As they should). Both are important things to remember so we do not repeat the same mistakes over and over. It does not bother me if you think of this country’s fathers fondly. As you should, they were ultimately good people with flaws. Just do not forget their flaws.\nI would like to make a true democractic country where anybody will be able to head the Second Republic. We can only break this taboo, if we make the head of state a president rather than a prime minister. Where everybody goes to the polls to vote one guy or girl. That is the only way to break the taboo of communalism. It will not happen overnight, but it will happen eventually. All it takes is a competent woman or man from any minority group to step forward and prove his dedication to the population. I unfortunately am from the majority group but I am sure, that a potential and competent President from a minority will show up eventually. My vision of the Second Republic does not have a presidential mandate limit. A president is elected for 6 years. The president will have his own cabinet or administration. The president will have the task to make a budget proposal to the house every year, who will need to discuss it and vote on it. There will be no prime minister. We are not that big a country to need it. The president is the head of government and of the state. The country will have parliamentary elections every three years instead of the current five so people may actively show if they have confidence in their president’s party. We will not have a senate, we do not have the population for that. Most important nominations will come from the president and will be handled by committes of parliament ultimately requiring 2/3 bipartisanship, so as to safeguard against despotism. Bills will require a small bipartisanship effort most times with them requiring 3/5 votes to pass to the president for signing. Presidents will be able to veto any bill that passes that way unless the president is countered with a 2/3 vote of parliament.\nI want to completely decentralise police powers to districts and have them co-operate with a state department (who will keep districts in check) that is heavily regulated by parliament, free from any presidential control besides nominating an independent head (by law) which will need to be accepted by parliament. By law parliament can make the acceptance of this nomination harder than others by requiring [2/3,3/4] votes for it to pass to safeguard democracy. Same thing can be done with Supreme Court appointments and Central Bank Governors. These things are set by law, not by the president. So, parliament will have a lot more power than the president in this setting. The president will no longer make the law, unlike the prime minister now who is a king, he will merely carry out laws passed by parliament, meaning he will ‘’take care that the Laws be faithfully executed’‘. I want a bill of rights, that kills reasonable suspicion for arbitrary arrests that are used for the intimidation of the population currently and want to finally bring in probable cause as the correct standard. I want a country that severly reprimands a police officer for planting drugs into the home of an innocent civilian, by making him lose his state pension should he be found guilty of such an accusation in a court of law. I want to make it compulsory to not only educate kids about their consitution, but I want us to take maths seriously as a country. This is the kind of leader, that I want to be for the labour party and the Second Republic of Mauritius. I cannot say whether the labour party will accept me or not. I am tending an olive branch to them, so they may keep their place in history along with their fathers’ history. If they are smart enough, they will take it. If they are not, I’ll eventually create something new, and wipe the slate completely clean if the support for such a Republic is here.\nAfter all, what I want and what you probably want as well, is what no party has wanted for 56 years. For the Kingdom of Mauritius to become finally and permanently become The Republic of Mauritius by giving it a real system of checks and balances that can actually keep each other in check. That is the real challenge for our country. To make a system that can outlast me and anybody that comes. To make a system that will resist even the most crooked president our country might one day have. Our current one did not. We are broke.\nIn any circumstances, appealing the heavens is a terrible thing and I wish to avoid it at all costs. It is not kind. But I am simply being real with you as to what is potentially ahead. I am resolved to do what must be done if it comes to it. You must be prepared too, if it comes to it, if you want to partake in this fight for the country’s independence. I sincerely hope I alone am enough. It is possible that with enough capital flight and enough popular support, I alone will be enough. Whether war comes however, is not on me or you. I have not been Prime minister of the Monarchy of Mauritius for 56 years. You have not either. What comes is on them. These successive governments for 56 years. That is valid for the entire world. The dumbducks of this world caused whatever is coming by being shit governments and by stealing all the resources of their countries. Not me, not you, or even you internet foreigner who lives in another country. You think, if everything was good with Mauritius I would be here? You think you would be here, reading this article and deeply relating to it. Itching to go to war? Come on now. There is a reason for all of this. The situation is catastrophic. That is why, I want to avoid all of this, imperatively. You the young people with your vote, can be the game-changer that allows this country to avoid not only a revolution but the game-changer that secures your future and your children’s future, which you know currently is the bleakest it has ever been. So I guess the real question is, If I come out of the shadows, can I count on you to protect me with your life? Given, government will want to kill me because I threaten the bullies’ absolute despotism that has now lasted 56 years. Will you fight back if need be? Will you stake your life too if it comes down to it? Will you appeal the heavens with me if we are forced to, for our independence just like the United States of America once did?\n\nTo be honest with you this is it for me. I do not believe in free will. I am a determinist that believes everything is already determined since the big bang. I either become your president or die trying. If die I must, then by god’s will alone will I die, happily fighting for my country with a smile on my face.",

    "text": "Like most of you, I have lived my entire life in the Republic of Mauritius. Over the years though, there are some disturbing things that I have found out, about this country we all call home. The elites in the private sector and the public sector are legitimately the dumbest people I have ever seen in my life. They rely on the rest of the population as their crutch, to make up for their incredible amount of incompetence. That has led the Republic of Mauritius to be a country of mediocrity, that after 56 years of independence is completely stuck because these dumbducks are holding it back. The country we live in is not progressing anymore. It has not progressed at all for years. This country’s elites are so incompetent, that the government is willingly encouraging people to leave their own homes, by making their lives harder and facilitating more imports of foreign workers in every sector, because they are much easier to exploit. It is akin to hitting two birds with one stone, given they also push people, who in all likelihood would not vote for them. Everybody knows that the imported labor is underpaid and overworked. Do you understand, how unkind these people at the top are? They would do it to you too, if labor laws were not here to protect you. They are conspiring with the government literally to push you away from your home. From your place of birth because they are too incompetent. So with you, they change tunes. They will gaslight you, and scream you are lazy, they will demean you, and scream that you are apparently a bum — When the bitter truth is that they cannot afford to pay you a decent living wage because their costs would increase too much and they would go bankrupt. Because of their own incompetence, not yours. They need slaves to compensate for their incompetence. To exploit. These are horrible people. These people will never stop. This has been going on for 56 years and it will go on for 56 more unless you stand up.\nIt’s not like this country lacks competence today. There are very competent people waiting on the sidelines, to be able to get the opportunity to help their country. You, the young people of the Republic of Mauritius, who eagerly await for someone to recognize your talent and reward you for your true worth. You need to accept that you need someone competent to be able to do that. That is never going to happen, in the current Mauritius. Unfortunately, kindness, in and of itself does not actually exist. What exists is competence. You can only be as kind as you are competent in this world. A dumbduck, on the other hand, cannot be kind. We are in a very fucked up situation to be honest, which is why I have in the end taken it upon myself to do something about it. I deserve better too. You have a country filled with undeserving, incompetent people hogging all its wealth and bullying the rest of the population. These people have bankrupted the country repeatedly over the past 56 years. This will end very badly going forward, if someone does not responsibly step in and end this degeneracy once and for all. I am doing the dumbducks a favor here. Saving them from their own stupidity. This country we live in, let us be real here is completely ruined financially. If someone does not do anything, this can only end into a revolution the longer this drags on like in Sri Lanka.\nAt this point, I know too much to turn a blind eye. I am competent enough you see, to not need anybody currently in either the private sector or the public sector. You see, I am interested, in a Mauritius that does massive semiconductors manufacturing. Cars manufacturing. Electronics manufacturing. In letting a multinational like Intercontinental Exchange, open a clearing house here called ICE Africa, to establish Mauritius as the core of Africa in Finance. I am interested, in a Mauritius whose population is closer to ~6-8 million rather than the 1.3 million it currently is. I am not interested in the periphery Mauritius, that you come to, when you need to set up some funds here, to evade taxes or launder some dollars that you steal from your people’s home country as a statesman. In the periphery Mauritius you come to do textiles manufacturing. I am simply not interested in menial labor intensive manufacturing which is what we currently do. I am simply not interested in the Mauritius that exists today. It is disgusting. It is literal hell. All it does is exploit, exploit, exploit. It is a prison. It is all it claims not to be. I am not interested in the dumbducks or their future, wealth or prosperity. I could not give less of a fuck about protecting their interests. I am interested in you, the young people. The unused talent of this country. The STEM and non-STEM majors. I am interested in you, the future of the Republic of Mauritius. Because I cannot do this alone. I need you, the competent people to take a stand. Together, we can rebuild this country.\nBut you must understand, the very conundrum that this poses for the dumbducks. You see while the dumbducks are a rare breed, because there is so few of them. They control a large part of the country. A few families control more than 50% of the entire economy of the Kingdom of Mauritius. Thing is, this country is not the free market it so likes to claim. This country is tailor made for a group people. So tailor-made, that the government had to literally destroy a conglomerate called British American Investment, to prevent it from becoming the leading conglomerate of the Republic of Mauritius. The only smart duck in town that was killed off. This is how tailor-made this country is. You are really in a fancy prison, if you are educated enough to see through the facade, that the dumbducks have set up. The majority of the people in politics in this country are families and related. Almost all of them have never brought anything to the table besides history, that is their father’s or mother’s name or the fact that they were related. They practice a modern form of inbreeding to keep their inner circle small because only two political parties have sway in the country. They both use race to do politics. Really, when you look at it objectively, Mauritius is just the Europe of the 1780’s-1800’s. It is an abomination that must end. And It will end. What has started here, signals the end of the monarchy of mauritius. Where, all the laws, are carefully drafted so that the chosen elites have zero competitors and enjoy monopolies. Trademark laws or what is known as patent exhaustion are carefully made so, you cannot be a competitor to someone representing a brand from abroad. How is this a free market? It is not. It is just one of the many many lies the country perpetuates. Lots of crazy propaganda in this country, one, I remember, that was popular when I was young – is that it is the only country in the world where education and health were free. Your parents believed that lie. Even my parents believed that lie. But that is all it ever was. Lies. We call propaganda. Propaganda exists to manipulate uneducated people. To make obedient sheep. Slaves. Truth is, most countries have socialist policies. All this country has ever really done is copy laws from other countries. Truth is parallel imports would have done much more for you than free healthcare ever did.\nThe truth is they lie, and that is all they do. They are good at it. That is the only thing they excel at. I guess stealing public money is another thing most of them excel at. They make shit up to seem competent. They will pay a shit ton of money to get into a university, earn a piece of paper to fake their competence. But cannot even use an excel sheet. They are so insecure that they will abuse their authority over the police to bully you if you ever are a threat to them. Things are so bad that these days, some outright fake the fact that they do not even have the qualifications they claim. They fake the paper altogether rather than just faking their competence. That is how incompetent our country has become after 56 years. Unfortunately, because our parents were not given the chance to have the education we have been offered, they bought these lies for 56 years. They could not see through these phonies. They thought, that these people were the best of the country. That they are competent. A lot of people actually believe that. That some politicians have saved our country. That they are the reason Mauritius progressed. You cannot hold it against your parents, to have been sucked in communalism propaganda. You cannot even hold it against you if you have been sucked in communalism propaganda for that matter. This is your chance to change though. Unlike your parents who are probably too far gone. To their credit, everybody was sucked in from that generation. They got sucked in because they could not know better. They were denied an education. This was their education. To be racist. They were indoctrinated, by the politics of the Republic of Mauritius for 56 years. Most old people in the Republic of Mauritius are extremely racist. You should however never hold it against them. They did not choose to be racist. They were forced to be racists. We would all be racists too, had we been given the same education our parents and grandparents were given which was not one. It was a school of propaganda. Of castes. Of religious hate. Of sowing the seeds of discord and violence. Of encouraging discrimination. It is how disgusting, the politics of that generation was and still is to this day. Their definition of what democracy is, is therefore colored by all that indoctrination. Just like the definition of democracy to most North Koreans is to have a supreme leader that controls everything, because they are indoctinated to believe that.\nFor all those reasons, it is unlikely that your parents would understand any of this. Because they are victims, in all of this, who have been abused by politics for 56 years and they do not even know it. They do not have the required education to be able to process all of this. They cannot understand that, they have been lied to, played with, by religion for 56 long years while the resources of the country were mismanaged by all the governments. Just like they cannot understand that the government is fooling them by using printed central bank money to increase their pension which will only increase the cost of living and make their life harder, not easier. But it seems destiny had other plans for you. I want to be very clear. Yes, the current government will go down as the worst in the history of the country but other governments stole just as much by funneling public money into their close circle’s bank accounts by being intermediaries rather than service providers on all tenders that the government puts out. Do not be stupid, by thinking there was a ‘’good government’’. Good governments, do not exist. That is why laws exist. Good laws are what the Republic of Mauritius needs. Nobody has done anything though for 56 long years, because they all enjoyed stealing the resources of the country when it was their turn at bat. Everybody has stolen money. You live in a country where the top companies have continuously gone bust for over 56 years, only to be given your hard-earned money so they can do it all over again. That is the law of the Republic of Mauritius. In it, you are a prisoner if you are not born, in some select families. If you do not somehow suck up, to the right person, suck some dick if you are extremely unlucky, your ambitions will always have ceilings. Competence is irrelevant in this country. Because dumbducks do not have it. And they set the rules. So, to you the people of competence. You have to change the game. That is the only option.",

    "text": "The Monarchy of Mauritius\nIn essence, what has been happening in Mauritius for 56 years is what was happening in Europe when Kings and Queens existed. The monarchy was filled with dumbducks. They had to put their people through increasingly more and more misery, as time went on, the more they let them rule and bully them. It is literal hell these days if you are someone young looking at what the Republic of Mauritius is turning into. Dumbducks will often talk of ‘’experience’’ because they do not have anything else to offer. But ask them experience of what? and get the blankest of stare. They legitimately know nothing actually useful. Well, I guess I am being unfair. They have experience in how to magically and shamelessly forget they stole public money and how both political parties allow the import of all the drugs in the country. The most ridiculous thing about all of this, is that they believe they are fooling you like they fooled your parents for fifty six years. They are arrogant as fuck. They are killing people literally with all the drugs they import. They think you do not know, it is them. That both parties have dabbled in it at some point in the last 56 years. It is so disrespectful, to think this lowly of the young people of this country. I do not even understand, how these people can show their faces everyday, come on camera and talk the shit they do. Do you hear yourself? Do you have dementia or something? I am genuinely impressed at this level of shamelessness, I have to admit. But this should be proof to you that they will not stop bullying you and killing the children of this country until you do something about it. These people literally don’t give a fuck about anything but their pockets.\nThere are a lot competent people today in the Republic of Mauritius. But they do not come from the right family. The right political party. They do not come from the right race. They do not come from the right caste. They do not come from the right skin color. In the past, all these things, these made up bullshit arbitrary rules, like caste, religions were used to brainwash your parents, to divide this country, so that the dumbducks could rule. Politicians made this country more and more racist because it was the only way for them to win for 56 years. It is a pity that religion sided with them for some money under the table. Using god for your own selfish and disgusting interest? Like politician, like religious leader. Must be nice. To have the ability to be so shameless. However, we do not have to continue with that tradition of doing politics with race and religion. I have no need for it. I am religious person who actively practices and respects god. I personally would not mind legislating so it is impossible to do politics with religion hereon. As for race, that is up to you to hold your politicians to a better standard onwards. Come on now, this is for the best, for the whole country. We want meaningfull, educated speeches from politicians. The trash should sort itself out of politics if such a law is passed. I am hoping with your help, we can truly turn a new leaf, where we will live by new rules. Principally, of letting education finally do its job. Of allowing competence to bloom. There is no other way. We need the most competent to be given the opportunity to become the richest in this country. So the most competent can make this country an advanced economy with their hard work. The first step is to do that is to understand the prison you live in, so as to not repeat your parents’ choices for 56 years that have shaped your own destiny, to bring you here. Helpless, with no future. Do you want your own child to go through this kind of abuse tomorrow again 56 years in the future ? Then it is time to stop the bullies.\nYour parents could not understand these simple truths because they have been brainwashed. They cannot understand that American presidents have in no way shaped the success of America like its people and its immigrants. They cannot understand this bitter truth, that is nonetheless true — That The Republic of Mauritius has only been held back by its politicians for 56 years. All of them have misused the resources of this country. They have condemned it by their actions to become as poor as it did today. That is simple cause and effect. Basic science, your parents cannot understand. Dumbducks have condemned your life to become so hard. And it will only get harder, each extra day you allow them to bully you. The dumbducks are the source of all your misery not all your success like your parents have been brainwashed to believe. That is all these politicians and private sector people really are. Bullies, who use the state’s resources to their leisure. I wish they were geniuses and competent people. My life would be easier. Your life would be easier. You think Microsoft and Nvidia managers complain that Bill Gates and Jensen Huang were too competent that they made them millionaires over night? Nobody would complain if the dumbducks were competent, not even me. They are not though. You are. You are competent and among you there are geniuses. You could replace these people, if you were good enough, easily in a free market. I will make this country a completely free market so that anyone can take on any conglomerate and actually WIN if they are better than them.",

    "section": "Macrodynamics",
    "text": "Macrodynamics\nSo far, we have only looked at real ouput growth as increases in consumption and savings. We could in theory be more precise with real output growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{y}}{y}=Y\\;\\) by rewriting it in another form where it depends on population growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{n}}{n}=N\\;\\) and productivity growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{g}}{g}=G\\) which is more appropriate for analysis rather than savings and consumption. If we therefore defined output growth as the following.\n\\[Y(G,N)\\]\nIt follows that any economy or society will be fine as long as \\(G+N&gt;0\\). However, with enough time, all economies will hit a point where \\(G+N=0\\) will be reached – this is where the society in essence peaks. That point is called the peak debt capacity of an economy. That is to say, that any economy anywhere in the world is eventually fated to collapse from either decreases in population or productivity growth but most importantly hitting its peak debt capacity. In all cases, both factors play a part. Meaning even the best economy out there. Pick your favorite, be it the United-States, Europe, China, India, Russia. They will all be bested by the simple condition (A). And, rest assured, the condition will always hold, given enough time, there is no escaping it. Economics does not work, with no perpetually increasing population, it breaks. For now though, that is the far away future’s shit to deal with. We cannot do anything anyway about such a problem. I guess make babies. As many as you can.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{A} \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial G} dG = -\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial N} dN \\end{equation}\\]\nWe can model the peak debt capacity with a logistic population differential equation where \\(D\\) is debt, \\(r\\) is the rate of growth of the debt, \\(L\\) is the peak debt capacity of the economy.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{8}\nY(G+N) = 0 \\Longleftrightarrow \\dot{D} = rD(L-D)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn fact, we can improve (8) by discussing interest rates and how they affect intertemporal growth, real savings and real consumption. So interest rates, are mappings to different real consumption and real savings combinations via the exchange rate \\(k\\) and via interest rate differentials. Interest rate differentials is not an exact science. It depends on a lot of things. But in general, for advanced economies, positive interest rate differentials, will always act like gravity and pull money to the higher interest rate currency and thus appreciate it while depreciating the lower interest rate one. If you are in a developping economy though. Even if you have a high interest rate, you are also an increasingly more risky investment. So, it might not matter.1\n\\[i \\mapsto k(i,i^{*}-i) \\quad \\cfrac{d k}{d i}&lt;0 \\]\nSo suppose, you have an economy with 20% inflation, how do you get it down? You need to increase real savings. What are the different ways of doing that? You can increase rates, so that people increase their real savings and cut consumption. Second, you can grow out of the inflation by growing the economy thus create new real savings. Third, you can cut spending as government and that cut spending would increase real savings. That should have been very obvious to you if you understood the first part. The second thing interest rates control is intertemporal growth. If you would modify (8) to add interest rates to it you would get the following.\n\\[ i \\mapsto G(i) \\quad i \\mapsto L(i)\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{9}\nY(G(i)+N) := \\dot{G} = -rG(i)(L-G(i))  \\Longleftrightarrow \\dot{D} = rD(L(i)-D)  \n\\end{equation}\\]\nAll right now if we impose a condition to (9) to be able to model output growth and debt capacity by making the condition, to max (9), we will get two logistic differential equation to model this situation. One where debt increases to reach 100% capacity and where GDP growth races to zero 0%. Indeed, in a world of debt, economics is always a race that is happening everywhere in the world. A race to zero growth. We won our race in Mauritius in 2019 and in doing so ironically lost, because no further growth was possible, without getting rid of a big chunk of our debt. Let me visually show you the graph of the solved ordinary differential equations so you may understand, if this is confusing you. Just to be clear we want to model (10) and a fair approximate solution to it, is solving the two ODE’s in (9).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{10}\n\\max_{G(i)} Y(G(i),N)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nShow the code\n%%capture\nimport numpy as np\nimport opinionated\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import odeint\nfrom opinionated.core import download_googlefont\n\nplt.style.use(\"opinionated_rc\") \ndownload_googlefont('Atkinson Hyperlegible', add_to_cache=True);\nplt.rc('font', family='Atkinson Hyperlegible')\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n## logistic debt capacity simulation\n\ny0 = [1] # start with 1 percent of debt capacity to go converge to 100 percent capacity\n\nt = np.linspace(0,200,num=1000)\n\nr = 0.05 # rate of increase exp(0.05)\nL = 100 # maximum debt capacity is 100%\n\n\nparams = [r,L]\n\ndef sim_debt(variables,t,params):\n\n    D = variables[0]\n\n    r = params[0]\n    L = params[1]\n\n    dDdt = r * D * (1 - D/L)\n\n    return([dDdt])\n\n\ny = odeint(sim_debt,y0, t, args=(params,))\n\n\n## logistic growth simulation\n\ny_0 = [0.10508] # start with 10% growth to converge to zero growth\n\n\nr_0 = 0.02 # rate of decay\nL_0 = 1 \n\n\nparams_0 = [r_0,L_0]\n\ndef sim_growth(variables,t,params_0):\n\n    G = variables[0]\n\n    r_0 = params_0[0]\n    L_0 = params_0[1]\n\n    dGdt = -r_0 * G * (1 - G/L_0)\n\n    return([dGdt])\n\n\ny_1 = odeint(sim_growth,y_0, t, args=(params_0,))\n\nf = plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))\nax = f.add_subplot(121)\nax2 = f.add_subplot(122)\nax.plot(t,y)\nax.set_xlabel('Time')\nax.set_ylabel('Debt Capacity %')\nax2.plot(t,y_1)\nax2.set_xlabel('Time')\nax2.set_ylabel('GDP Growth %')\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you understand this graph? This graph is speaking to you and telling you as you get closer and closer to your debt capacity your growth will slowly wane. That is extremely deep insight. You should only start worrying when your country’s potential growth (trend) hits sub 1%. Before that, you can chill. So the moment you hit your debt capacity, your economy will peak because it will be forced to save to repay past debts, and will therefore be unable to generate growth, because you will need to cut consumption to be able to pay your debts back. This is a deterministic and unavoidable dilemma if you have no absolute debt ceiling which is always unpopular. The Republic of Mauritius hit its debt ceiling before 2019 and peaked in 2019, but was faking its growth, therefore the debt ceiling turned out to be completely useless. It tends to be like that unfortunately. Most countries today are playing with numbers. Once you reach this point however, you have to get rid of the debt, in one way or another. You cannot not pay. That is generally the problem, because you have defaulted now, unofficially. So, you have to print money either sneakily or using excuses like the Republic of Mauritius itself did in 2019 else you cannot cover your liablities and the cat would be out of the bag. So, a popular way is to inflate it away. You see, it is always better to pass the buck on someone else or something else. That is what the Republic of Mauritius has been doing in a typical narcissistic fashion I guess. Congratulating itself in the way and even going so far as to say that it is helping you. The shamelessness is crazy with these people. They are really just killing your future which is fine for them because that way their future gets brighter. On top of that they come on camera and tell you they are doing you a favor. Sheesh.\nThe other way to deal with your debt capacity is to take it to the limit. Only advanced economies can do this. You need to be productive enough to do this. You see, if we take capacity of the debt to its limit what would the equation spit out? What is the upper bound? Let’s take it to the limit and see by setting \\(L=1\\).\n\\[\\lim_{i\\to 0} L(i) = \\frac{L}{i} = \\infty \\]\nSo, that’s cool right? You can actually hold your own, by hanging on to close to zero growth, by pushing rates down as much as you can. In the real world, you call that using negative interest rates. You reduce interest payments temporarily by doing that. However, it is actually the worst of solutions, given you are allowing yourself to take a lot more debt. Debt is basically borrowing against, not only future hours of work but its rewards too. Claiming it now. Claim too much debt and you make it impossible for the system to continue because it would be the equivalent of slavery. Finesse is needed to find the right balance. The problem with this method is, it needs a lot of conditions for it to be reliable over a long enough period of time. In that time, where all the conditions hold, you will inevitably overreach and take too much debt, because it becomes ‘’too affordable’‘. It will be too difficult to resist. If US rates \\(i^{*}\\) rise though, you will get screwed, if raising rates would put you into default. Your exchange rate will thus suffer from \\(i^{*}-i\\) and you will get a surge of inflation. It can still work in some cases. You see, as long as you are creating new real savings, that is as long as there is growth, you should be somewhat fine, increasing real consumption. In zero growth though, you will be screwed, because debt repayments will require you to cut consumption by an equal amount for the derivatives’ total change to be zero as can be seen in \\((11)\\).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{11}\n\\dot{y}_{r}(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    &gt;0,& p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&lt;0 \\\\\n    0, & p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&lt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&lt;0 \\\\\n    &lt;0,& p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&lt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&gt;0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAll in all, while this can feel like a genius idea. It really is not. It is incredibly selfish. That is the crazy thing though. Anything is better than paying back debt because paying back debt means having no money to steal. Let me tell you, human nature is a special kind of madness. This is the main reason why most deleveragings happen via inflation. You get control on spending then. You can steal public money then. Although if it is not backed by real savings as shown in \\((11)\\), it is met with a different curve of inflation that increases at an increasing rate. Because there is negative productivity (dilution of existing savings) because when \\(\\dot{y}_{r}(t)&lt;0\\), then the only thing that increases are nominal \\(\\dot{c}^{n}_{t}&gt;0\\) and \\(\\dot{s}^{n}_{t}&gt;0\\) which increases at an increasing rate which is what has happened from 2020 to now. Minimum wages increasing 90% is not a normal thing to be proud of. Worse, you now see the dark side of these allocations and the horror it is trying to hide because they are not permanent. What has been happening now for four years is a catastophic deterministic consequence of an economy that is collapsing. This is what is truly happening in the Republic of Mauritius from excessive spending to try to win elections and of course stealing of public money, and hitting our debt limit. Because you cannot be gifted anything when there is nothing to give (new real savings). So, your own current real savings will need to get diluted to pay for this excessive spending and stealing. Do you understand now, why governments gladly take making your lives harder rather than doing the right thing? It is because, this is best for them. For you to suffer. Rather than them suffering, by just paying back the debts and not stealing, they would rather steal, pay the debts and cut your consumption. That is human nature for you. That is why, you have to vote competent people up there. People who will not have to exploit you this much. It is a deterministic result of incompetence. It is impossible for the incompetent to not exploit you. LITERALLY. Now, the general problem with excessive spending is that most people have no hard assets to count on, so when governments print money or devaluates their currency, they cannot get some of their lost value back via price rises in those assets. So the wealth of the lower middle class and the lower class just kind of collapses, when this is set in motion. They lose most, given the upper and upper middle class have assets that can rise in value whenever these things happen. They lose, do not get me wrong but they lose twice as less. Overall though, the deleveraging process will the lower wealth \\(w_{t}\\) of the entire country by \\(k_{t}\\) increasing as evidenced in \\((12)\\). If you are wondering whether we (our country) are poorer than we were in 2020. We definitely are sadly. Still, they are richer, which is all that matters to them.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{12}\nw_{t} = \\cfrac{ \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} y_{t}}{k_{t}} \\quad  \\cfrac{d w}{d k}&lt;0 \\quad \\cfrac{d w}{d y}&gt;0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow, here is the good news, as you know if you max growth via lower rates you will race to zero. However, if you put a debt ceiling up, then you can change the global minimum of (10). That is a quite the good news. Because, what you probably have not noticed yet, is that because of intertemporal growth, there are trade offs involved, in this simulation we just did. Who lived the best lives? Obviously the people who lived in the first 100 periods. So what about the people in the next 100 periods? What do they get? Close to nothing. They were robbed by the people in the first 100 periods. That is how debt works ultimately. This is you right now in the Republic of Mauritius. What do you get? You get nothing because there is nothing to get. The state has already borrowed, the money that should have been reserved for you to make your life better. Your hours of work has already been borrowed against, the money reserved for you stolen and spent elsewhere to help the private circles of politicians and the private sector. All you get to be now in this life is being a slave and going to work, so they can enjoy their lives. Cruel is it not? Your entire life has already been determined by the people stealing public money buying cars, villas, houses. Will you accept that life?\nSo, this spike of inequality in Mauritius right now was caused by none other than the Government of the Republic of Mauritius itself2. They knew GDP was fake, given they compiled it that way to be able to borrow more. So, this is a huge problem. This is what you have been voting for 56 years. The same shit happened in the 1980’s did it not? That is a worldwide problem, not exclusive to the Republic of Mauritius. Respecting debt limits and knowing what limit is appropriate is a key thing to look at carefully in the future because it is the biggest way to decrease inequality intertemporally for every Mauritian that will ever live. One simple solution is to use absolute limits like the United-States does so as to make faking statistics useless, in manipulating the state’s ability to take more debt that it can muster at any given time. One thing to avoid, is also to not increase the absolute limit every 3-4 years like the US does which makes it useless.\nDo you understand now? The value of being well educated. Of understanding how the world works. This is a tiny sliver of the amount of knowledge that is out there. This is not even the surface of economics if you would one day want to truly understand it. Yet, I have altered the world you live in if you take the time, and truly understand the math in here. It is so intuitive. You will never need to rely solely on statistics, if you understand it. Your eyes and your knowledge of economics will be enough for you to always know, how any country is doing. Do you finally understand why the entire world, sooner or later, can only head in a spree of revolutions, as the true positions of all economies come up to surface? Only the United States is currently safe from a revolution. Unless, it recklessly puts itself in that position by taking too much debt. Do you understand now, why even though I wish, it did not need to come to that. We might very well, have have no choice. The world is going to shit.",

    "text": "There is a disease in the Republic of Mauritius called clout chasing by the kids of the big name politicians who sadly could not achieve much and so must rely on their good father’s name even though they did not accomplish much too but unlike them their legacy is ‘’purer’‘. That is because the illusion that they did’‘everything’’ is still very much intact and strong. Again your parents would not understand this. They have been indoctrinated. Do not even try to convince your parents, given telling someone they have been living in a delusional world for 56 years is devastating and is bound to be met with resistance. Like the uselessness of race and communalism, this too is something that your parents must come to terms with on their own. You cannot force someone to accept something they cannot understand, yet. They will eventually understand it, while some never will. That is the power of indoctrination for you. By design, it is only useful to make someone become more and more closed off about the real nature of things. To be less and less disagreeable. That is why it is a fan favorite among dictatorships in human history.\nSo, the first thing we should do is separate the founding fathers of the country and their kids. I have nothing against them. They did not do anything particularly important than any other Mauritian did not do during their lifetime, but they also never let this country turn into the degenerate fuck fest it is today, where everybody is stealing the state’s resources left and right. Which is basically the same thing that happened with the previous government. The old timers, ironically wanted what was best for their country but were simply unequipped, to be able to do anything for their country. They could not afford to be as kind as they had hoped to be. They played their part as best as they could but we need to be honest here. They had no clue what they were doing, besides securing their self interests at all times. So, naturally, like any father, they gladly stole from the state so that their family’s future was guaranteed. Who would not, with the laws that we had back then? Stealing was free back then. Without any risk. This is what eventually brought the country to its knees, in the 1980’s. Like today, back then, the buck was again passed onto anything that moves. But the cause of the country’s collapse back then was as simple as it is today. Mismanagement of our resources by the politicians and elites of the country. They of course, got around it just fine by lying back then and today. But in doing that they condemened this country to this future, it now must deal with. They paved the way for their kids to become the way they are today, a reflection of them. They protected their kids when they commited crimes for which they never served time. They showed their kids, this country is the one place where they can do whatever they wanted. They stole and stole and stole. All they needed do to get around it was to lie. People knew no better, education was nowhere to be seen back then.\nThey looked down on the population of the Republic of Mauritius. You could not live with yourself otherwise. The guilt of lying to the population everday would kill you. Eat you alive. You would kill yourself. You could not lie so much to someone you loved. Only someone you looked down on. Someone, you had no respect for. They looked down on you as ‘things’, that exist so they can live good lives, and rationalised their actions. I am sorry to be so honest with you but this is not a choice. If you are incompetent, you simply cannot afford kindness. It is you or them. If you choose them, you oust yourself as an incompetent. No politician has ever done that. So their kids did the same things as well. Just like most of the world looked at people of the lower class, back in the day, as non humans — slaves. They are not different. They are just human beings. Either they are competent enough to be kind to you or incompetent enough that they are forced to enslave you and look down on you. So that is why, their kids lie so much today. Plenty of proof out there for the curious ones, like the one where someone makes racist remarks about the allocation of houses for the NHDC but a striking one is a video online, where a politician that was kicked from the ruling party says that the older people are just a bunch of suckers. The irony is that they destroyed themselves with that one. All the mainstream politicians think of you as suckers. Proof of that is in what the political game has turned into. A bidding war. Offering you money when inflation has been so high but thinking ‘’These suckers would never know, all I have to do is fake the inflation, and they would vote me’’. In other words, in their heads it goes something like this.1\nThis is what the politics of this country has turned into.2 Their actions made you this poor, increased inequality this much and yet they dare act as if they are doing you a favor. Is that all your worth ? A few worthless rupees in 2024. Can’t really blame them though, they cannot afford to do anything else. They do not know anything else. Lying is all they have. Lying is their bread and butter. Lying got them so far. They are naked dumbducks without it. To be honest with you what is happening in Mauritius is surreal. I am not saying, this does not happen everywhere in the world, it does. But the surreal part is the word democracy. This country for some reason is deemed a full democracy when it has no free market, no free competition, no liquid capital markets so that talent can freely emerge, no robust infrastructure for securitization, a pathetic capital market that cannot even link mortgages to treasuries or overnight rates. A country that has only had two prime ministers with a brief special appearance of a third. Democracy? Where buddy? Where? How the fuck did these people get to where they are? How many people did they kill exactly over 56 years? They cannot be kind, they must have killed thousands by now indirectly with all that drugs trade. Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware of this? How long will you go on with this charade? For what? A few bank notes here and there? Everyday a new family is destroyed so these people can afford to fund their election campaigns. So these people can afford to buy things to gift you to win general elections. Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware, they give tax money willy nilly to a small group of people because they expect a large cut of it back? Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware that they use public money to do their electoral campaigns? Are we supposed to act as if we give a fuck about them when they give not a fuck about us circa 1968? Are we supposed to let this kind of insolence go unanswered? Where is the respect? Can’t even steal discreetly and ingeniously can you?",

    "text": "Economic Development\nYou should have already deduced this by now if you read the previous article, but The Kingdom of Mauritius has collapsed twice in its history. Meaning this is the second time that we have reached zero growth. The first time was in the 1980’s. This brings up the obvious question. How the hell did this country ever progress to even come here? The answer is with the beauty of free trade and a lot of luck. Mauritius would have been a lot more developped than it is today had it not been held back by its bad management. You see, back in the day, Europe had a thing for colonies for some reason, and it knew just the way to bolster its relation with newly freed countries. Some free money and some preferential trade agreements to get into the good books of some African countries. Of those, Mauritius belonged to. The Yaounde Convention, The Lome agreement for ACP countries were some of the names of the agreements but that is not the most important part. The most important part is, Mauritius got a preferential trade agreement to sell sugar in the European Common Market which the UK was part of at the time. That allowed it to build a sizeable amount of savings. Unfortunately, we had no real understanding of the world. On the advice of international economists’, Mauritius tried to industrialise by increasing tarrifs as a way to force the local conglomerates to go into manufacturing to do what is called import substitution industrialisation.\nOf course, it was a lost cause, given the domestic demand of the country was a drop of water into the ocean that is world GDP. There was no way to be competitive in anything, or export anything because there was obviously no economies of scale. It was just a dumb decision that showcased how bad a hand we had been dealt with in both the public and private sector. It was kind of wasted money. Because we did not know anything, we had no patents, no knowledge of anything. We still don’t to this day, to be honest. We just import machinery in this country. We do not invent them. It is the only reason we do not have any modern banking infrastructures. Modern open banking where anybody could build applications have to be built. Modern government infrastructure have to be built. You can’t import things like that. Until the US finds a reliable way to simplify it greatly alteast. You have to build your own stuff. The thing is, we can build it today. But the people who can, are not the leaders of the country. Leaders of companies. That is why we need change things. The people who can do these things are here and dying to help their country. Their country does not want their help. There are plenty of very competent software engineers in the country. Anyway, we lost a lot of savings in useless import substitution and when you add to that the stealing of resources, you get the collapse of the 1980’s.\nSo then how did the Economic Miracle happen? The devil is in the details. The economic miracle did happen and was a miracle of free trade but most importantly, it was an economic miracle because of what the fate of african countries generally were. It was a miracle bacause we escaped our pre-determined fate of being branded as a banana republic by the international community. Although, the joke is obviously on us given we are a banana republic today. It was a sarcastic jab in some sense. What happened was in the real world by no means extraordinary but when you placed it in context, what happened took place in Africa. That was the miracle, not what anybody did but rather the fact that an African country had finally been able to leave the trenches of Africa. So to who do we owe this success ? To everybody, who worked hard at the time, and that of course includes SAJ and any other politician but also any ‘labourer’. But the biggest contributor remains external, free trade. You see, sometimes things align by people just following their self-interests and the magic of free trade happens. When import substitution failed, SSR backpedaled and decided to turn that project into what became export processing zones or ‘’zone franche’’ if you lived in that time. That would have failed too but problems started emerging in international trade in the 1970’s. Problems that needed solutions. Some countries were exporting excessively in the advanced economies and so the Multi Fiber Arrangement was made to impose quotas and limit exports from developping countries to developped ones. That was a boon for mauritius, who as a country whose quotas remained unused benefitted tremendously from it. Because it forced a lot of taiwanese and hong kong manufacturers to come here to be able to go above their quotas and continue fulfilling their orders to those developped countries. The local conglomerates copied and learned from them and eventually bought some of their factories. So, we indeed got a miracle. An African miracle because we truly did something that was impossible.

A good year would push GDP up only for it to contract and go down again the next because of bad weather conditions. Textiles, on the other hand were consistent. World population was rising, they needed to be clothed and so we got a free ticket from fulfilling that need that allowed us to get out of the trenches of poverty that plagued Sub Saharian Africa back then and still does to this day. But this is where all our problem ironically start as well. You see, we have not done anything since the 1980’s beside import all the capital we can afford. We have imported a lot of capital, transitioned to a services economy which was a bad thing to do given that is what made us converge to zero growth. We decreased our long term productive capacity slowly for short term profits which pushed us to zero growth in 2019. It is good to say this bluntly. Our country, de-industrialised without having ever really been fully industrialised first. Why? Because we do not know shit. You can only do shit you know. Like exploit elsewhere where labor is cheaper for labor intensive manufacturing in India. What about here though? All we excelled at was importing capital. Be a jack of all trades. Good at nothing but present everywhere.",

    "text": "There is a disease in the Republic of Mauritius called clout chasing by the kids of the big name politicians who did not really do anything special for the country. Like father, Like son, Like daughter I guess. Again your parents would not understand this. They have been indoctrinated. Do not even try to convince your parents, given telling someone they have been living in a delusional world for 56 years is devastating and is bound to be met with resistance. Like the uselesness of race and communalism, this too is something that your parents must come to terms with on their own. You cannot force someone to accept something they cannot understand, yet. They will understand it, but it will take time and most importantly they will only understand it through their own lenses. I do not possess that lense, nor do I know how to reach it. If you do, you could give it a shot, but I would just leave it alone.\nSo, the first thing is to separate the founding fathers of the country and their kids. I have nothing against SSR, SAJ and DUVAL. They did not do anything particularly important than any other Mauritian did not do during their lifetime, but they also never let this country turn into the degenerate fuck fest it is today where everybody is stealing the state’s resources left and right. Which is basically the same thing that happened with the previous government. The old timers, ironically wanted what was best for their country but were simply unequipped, to be able to do anything for their country. They could not afford to be as kind as they had hoped to be. They played their part as best as they could but we need to be honest here. They had no clue what they were doing, besides securing their self interest at all times. So, naturally, like any father, they gladly stole from the state so that their family’s future was guaranteed. Who would not, with the laws that we had back then? Stealing was free back then. Without any risk. This is what eventually brought the country to its knees, in the 1980’s. Like today, back then, the buck was again passed onto anything that moves. But the cause of the country’s collapse back then was as simple as it is today. Mismanagement of our resources by the politicians and elites of the country. They of course, got around it just fine by lying back then and today. But in doing that they condemened this country to this future, it now must deal with. They paved the way for their kids to become the way they are today, a reflection of them. They protected their kids when they commited crimes for which they never served time. They showed their kids this country is the one place where they can do whatever they wanted. They stole and stole and stole. All they needed do to get around it was to lie. People knew no better, education was nowhere to be seen back then.\nThey looked down on the population of the Republic of Mauritius. You could not live with yourself otherwise. The guilt of lying to the population everday would kill you. Eat you alive. You would kill yourself. You could not lie so much to someone you loved. Only someone you looked down on. Someone, you had no respect for. They looked down on you as slaves, that exist so they can live good lives, and rationalised their actions. So their kids did too. Just like most of the world looked at people of the lower class, back in the day. They are not different. They are just human beings. Either they are competent enough to be kind to you or incompetent enough that they are forced to enslave you and look down on you. So that is why their kids lie so much today. Plenty of proof out there for the curious ones, but a striking one is a video online, where a politician that was kicked from the ruling party says that the older people are just a bunch of suckers. The irony is that they destroyed themselves with that one. All the mainstream politicians think of you as suckers. Proof of that is in what the political game has turned into. A bidding war. Offering you money when inflation has been so high but thinking ‘’these suckers would never know, all I have to do is fake the inflation, and they would vote me’’. In other words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEN LANGAZ CREOL\n\n\n\n\nBOUS TO LIKI PREND GOGOT LARGENT LA EK VOTE MOI DO FALOURMAMA. 1 SOU RESPECT ZOT PENA POU TOI, TORMA EK TORPA.\n\n\n\nThis is what the politics of this country has turned into. Their actions made you this poor, increased inequality this much and yet they dare act as if they are doing you a favor. Is that all your worth ? A few worthless rupees in 2024. Can’t really blame them though, they cannot afford to do anything else. They do not know anything else. Lying is all they have. Lying is their bread and butter. Lying got them so far. They are naked dumbducks without it. To be honest with you what is happening in Mauritius is surreal. I am not saying, this does not happen everywhere in the world, it does. But the surreal part is the word democracy. This country for some reason is deemed a full democracy when it has no free market, no free competition, no liquid capital markets so that talent can freely emerge, no robust infrastructure for securitization, a pathetic capital market that cannot even link mortgages to treasuries or overnight rates. A country that has only had two prime ministers with a brief special appearance of a third. Democracy? Where buddy? Where? How the fuck did these people get to where they are? How many people did they kill exactly? They cannot be kind, they must have killed thousands by now indirectly with all that drug trade. This is what you have been voting for 56 years? What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you blind?",

    "text": "A world wide increase in living standards\nNow why is it then, that no political party has been able to reproduce another economic miracle in the Republic of Mauritius after the one that happened in the 1980’s? Why is it that no one knew what the ingredients to that initial success was, so that they could once again cook another miracle? Do you seriously never ask yourself that question? What did we have then that we do not have now? I already told you the answer. The answer is free trade. An ingredient that is out of our control because we did not do anything to make it happen. Globalisation happened, and the domination of free trade changed the world without anybody needing to be more competent. America, Europe and Asia brought their competenece forward and carried the world, by gifting them their labor intensive manufacturing operations by giving them their equipment as capital that they could import as they now moved to the capital intensive electronics age we live in. It is hard to fathom the value chains that free trade coupled network systems (the internet), and computers have made possible. It is crazy, how much living standards has improved because of it. Just like they did in the industrial revolution by increasing living standards by its biggest amount ever to give people worldwide basic plumbling through trade as long as they could afford it.\nAll of these, are things that you do not need to go invent today. All that is required of you is your co-operation for you to use these ready made things or technologies for most of things you do. You call that importable free technology. Even the materials for basic toilet plumbing is free importable technology. Technology that is freely importable is not longer considered technology however for the rest of the world that imports it. It is just capital. They rarely know anything about it. They will employ people that knows how to use the capital but not how to build it. It must be said that this is a phase every country must go through to sort itself out. Technology really allowed competence to bloom in most advanced economies where free markets existed. Most of the people at any of the fortune 500 companies today has nothing in common with their counter parts that led those companies post world war two. Most did not even exist back then. You must truly understand this current era we live in, is the most competitive the world has ever been. Especially among the top 500 companies in the world but only. Globalisation changes business and even academia. Everything became more competitive, music, comedy, tv, sports. To be at that level means that in your own way you can connect many fields of study. That is your value, you are not the smartest in any room. You can nevertheless enter almost any room and follow the conversations that are going on in them. That is what it takes to be a leader of a fortune 500 company today. To be the swiss army knife.\nThe Republic of Mauritius imports capital. It has none of that. It is not me being offensive. It is the truth. It cannot have it. We are a country that is not on any frontier of technology and science. We are a freeloader of the world by excellence. That is why there is no freemarket, no vision, nothing here. It is an empty island we all live in with a lot of talk. Empty nevertheless is all the talk. The past 56 years prove it enough. All we do is one thing. We just import capital and use the technology that is handed to us on a platter. Can barely fucking invent anything. In all sectors of the economy. We are collectors of companies but not good at anything in particular. There is so little competition in this country that some conglomerates own banks for some reason. There has never been a single landmark antitrust case or legislation. That is why the majority of our increases in real output comes from that solely. The accumulation of that free technology and the productivity that comes along from using that capital. Look the truth is, if our country had just one firm that did wealth management, that was better than any firm in the world, trillions of dollars would come rushing in the country, leaving New York, Beijing, Tokyo, Paris, and London. That is power of competence. I’m being real with you. The almighty dollar is enamored with competence. Of being able to do something better than others. Money circulates where the competence is because that is where the money can also be more efficiently used to generate more money.\nDo you understand that? The almighty dollar, does not care about consent. Where competence is high, it will go in flocks. But wait? It does come in Mauritius too in the global business sector? Why? What do we have here in Mauritius exactly? Does money come in for the competence in the global business sector? A lot of companies come here because of the possibility of setting up modern sweat shops here for labour intensive cheap backoffice accounting, the human resources administration services, and the sofware development services etc… Mostly though, in the case of global businesses, they come here because of the conveniences it provides them which hugely outweight the costs when it concerns setting companies to route investments to other places in the world. Because of the rule of law that is non existent, so that anybody can launder as much money as they want with properties and some other flimsly tricks via the global business sector. Giving companies the ability to evade taxes. That is not competence, that is a technicality. Technicalities are never permanent. They are loopholes engineered by powerful people wishing to evade taxes. The dollar that comes in flocks to our country only comes in flocks to pass through it to go somewhere else, and to benefit from DTAA’s. The biggest flow that is India’s is now dwindling as from 2024. So this very thing which has been holding Mauritius for the past ten years along with the sale of real estate to foreigners is bound to be the very thing that will be our undoing if capital flight happens.",

    "text": "Economic growth in the long run\nSo the people in control of this country are just as much headless chickens as the ones in the private sector. That is the biggest problem of the Republic of Mauritius. It would do you good to remember this, if competence does not exist, honest opinions cannot exist. Morality cannot exist. I cannot give a fuck about you if giving a fuck about you would mean, I lose my privileged place in society. That is just the blunt truth. I cannot give a fuck about you, if I all can do is kill your children to earn money by engaging in drugs trade. I cannot give my honest opinion if giving my honest opinion of things would mean government would close its tap of public money to me, which would bring me open to the most dreaded of possibilities, bankruptcy. The private sector really does not care as to who comes in power. It only cares about its interest. So it cannot give a single fuck about you. This makes politics pointless in the Republic of Mauritius. Because powerful people in the private sector are simply not equipped to give a fuck. They will all make generous contributions to all parties and do their best to stay in the good books of any government for their own self interests. Because there is zero competition, its all useless. It could only harm them to engage in anyway. They already have everything. A golden spoon given in the way laws are made for them. I am not saying the private sector does not care. Maybe they do but they are not allowed to care. Because they cannot go at it alone.\nI don’t really blame the conglomerates. I’m sorry. I just don’t. They are not politicians. None of them ever came on camera every week and pretended to give a fuck about you all. I am not even mad at the conglomerates for not potentially caring about the general population because it is basic human nature and nothing to frown upon. That is not their responsibility. I am only mad that dumb people stand at the top of the country. But your wellbeing and my wellbeing is not on them in the end. You should always expect them to be looking to earn the maximum amount they can, even the most competent person. As government, if you want morality to exist, you need to have laws that enable a lot of competition. Who would refuse to be given a monopoly in a market so they can get free money and be fed from a literal golden spoon.3 Allright, that should be enough destruction for this paper. Let’s get serious now, and focus on understading economic growth. Modern Economic growth is all Robert Solow and to a lesser degree Trevor Swan who both invented the Exogenous Growth Model after world war 2. Switch gears, it is going to get mathematical now.\nJust like price, in our last paper, output is not easy to estimate because there are so many different markets in a country, and yet, we can simplify things to make it easier to try to understand the behavior of output in the long run in any economy. The output you generally see that is reported in the news every quarter is estimated very laboriously just like price is. Which is why like inflation, output can be easily manipulated by playing with numbers. Mostly just modifying the GDP deflator will do the trick but sometimes you can be cheeky and boost production numbers too. The Republic of Mauritius has done both since 2013. From 2014 to 2019, government boosted production numbers. Since 2020, government has been boosting production numbers, and under reporting the GDP deflator. The methodology used to esimate output every quarter is owed to Wasilly Leontif for his invention of the input-output model. Basically, he suggested using linear algebra to calculate total output of a country. A friendly introduction to that if you want to learn it can be found here and is easy to digest.\nThe beauty of the exogenous growth model comes from being able to abstract all of this away by using assumptions that simplify the construction of the model. The models assumes that there is only one capital good that is produced, accumulated, and undergoes depreciation. There is perpetual full employment. That greatly simplies things in that we can simply use an aggregate production to construct the model. There is no inflation to consider but if we did consider them prices are perfectly flexible in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Assumption\n\n\n\nReal GDP \\(Y(t)\\) is determined by a production function using these two factors we just talked about. The one capital good and a predetermined amount of labor of which all are always employed i.e there is perpetual full employment. \\(Y=F(K,L)\\). One production function which can accomodate these assumptions is the Cobb-Douglas production function where.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\nY(t)= K^{\\alpha}(t)(A(t)L(t))^{1-\\alpha}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nLet’s go through each of the pieces of this.\n\n\\(K(t)\\) is the total stock of capital in the economy at time \\(t\\). This combines the values of all structures, equipment, and intellectual property used by all the establishments. More capital, more real GDP.\n\\(L(t)\\) is the total amount of labor in the economy at time \\(t\\). This could be a count of the number of workers, or we can get fancy and think of it as a combined stock of skills and abilities that those workers bring with them. Either way, more labor, more real GDP.\n\\(A(t)\\) is the level of productivity at time \\(t\\). We’ll have more to say later about what this really measures, but for now keep in mind that is measures how efficiently we use the capital and labor in the economy. Higher productivity, higher real GDP. This is what we simply do not have in Mauritius just FYI.\n\nLet us also look at why the Cobb-Douglas is the most common and popular choice among production functions. It is because it can handily respect the following conditions.\n\nThe first is CRS (Constant Returns to scale) which just means that a doubling of inputs will double output. Doubling capital and labor in mauritius will automatically double the output we produce. That is what it means.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{2}\nA(cK)^{\\alpha}(cL)^{1-\\alpha} = (c^{\\alpha} c^{1-\\alpha})Y = cY\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nThe second is the first and second derivative of output Y with respects to K or the Marginal Product of Capital (MPK). The cobb-douglas production function entails decreasing marginal returns to capital accumulation. This turns out to be the key element of the model. What does this mean in layman terms? If a firm acquires an extra unit of capital, it should raise its output. But if the firm keeps piling on extra capital without raising the number of workers available to use this capital, the increases in output will probably taper off. In the Cobb-Douglas case, the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) dictates the pace of this tapering off.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{3}\nY_{K} &gt; 0 \\quad Y_{KK} &lt; 0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe basics of the solow model are the following equations.\n\nCapital accumulates according to\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{4}\n\\dot{K}(t) = Y(t) - C(t) - \\delta K(t) = S(t) - \\delta K(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn other words, the addition to the capital stock each period depends positively on savings (this is a closed-economy model so savings equals investment) and negatively on depreciation, which is assumed to take place at rate \\(\\delta\\). In simple words, more savings equal a higher upper bound for our final capital stock and a higher depreciation will set a lower upper bound (supremum) for our final capital stock by making the cost of maintenance of capital higher.\n\nLabour input grows at rate n meaning\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{5}\n\n\\frac{dL}{dt}= nL \\quad L(t) = L_{0}\\exp(nt)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nLabour Efficiency or Productivity grows at rate g meaning\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{6}\n\n\\frac{dA}{dt}= gA \\quad A(t) = A_{0}\\exp(gt)\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nA fraction of output is saved each period which is also net investment.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{7}\nY(t)-C(t)= sY(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nMost elementary analysis of the solow model will be focused on understanding the steadystate. I will cover this so that you may test your understanding of what I have discussed with you so far. Suppose I solved the solow model for the following production function.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{8}\nY(t)=K^{0.5}(t)(AL^{0.5}(t))\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhat do we do know ? How do we proceed ? We could start by acknowledging (7) as the net increase in capital stock for every period or \\(\\dot{K}\\). Note that, I will leave out the time notation hereon because of tediousness involved in writing them all the time. So we get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{9}\n\\dot{K} = sY\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow we can insert (8) back in (9) to get (10)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{10}\n\\dot{K} = s(K^{0.5},(AL^{0.5}))\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow we could divide everything with a factor \\(c=\\frac{1}{AL}\\) to give us what ?\n\\[ \\frac{Y}{AL} = (\\frac{K}{AL},1) \\]\nWe could now define \\(y = \\frac{Y}{AL}\\) as output per effective worker and \\(k=\\frac{K}{AL}\\) as capital per effective worker. We would now thus end with the fundamental differential equation called the law of motion of capital in (11) by inserting (4), (5) and (6) in \\(\\frac{(10)}{c}\\)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{11}\n\\dot{k} = sy - (g + n + \\delta)k = sk^{0.5} - (g+n+\\delta)k\n\\end{equation}\\]\nGraphically or geometrically, we say that the change in \\(k\\) is given by the difference of \\(sy\\) and \\((g+n+\\delta)k\\). As long as \\(sy &gt; (g+n+\\delta)k\\) then \\(k\\) will increase. On the other hand as long as \\(sy &lt; (g+n+\\delta)k\\), you guessed it \\(k\\) will decrease. When \\(sy = (g+n+\\delta)k\\), yes you guessed it right again, that is where a steady state is reached and \\(\\dot{k}=0\\) or the change in k is zero. We can thus solve for the steady state capital per effective worker by making\n\\[0 = s(k^{*})^{0.5}-(g+n+\\delta)k^{*} = k^{*} = (\\frac{s}{n+g+\\delta})^\\frac{1}{1-0.5} \\]\nLikewise for steady state output per effective worker we find that output per worker grows at rate \\(n+g\\) ie at the rate that \\(AL\\) grows that is population growth and labor productivity. We call that the balanced growth path because this is basically a constant growth rate when \\(k^{*}\\) (the steady state is reached).\n\\[ y^{*} = (\\frac{s}{n+g+\\delta})^{\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}} \\]\nNow, people like to say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Let’s graph what this all means, in practice. Now, I will explain the graphs to you but, if you understood what has been discusses so far you should generally have an inkling of the explanations before I give them to you. Because the solow model is elegant and intuitive. So, if you can guess as the explanations. That’s a good sign that you have understood everything so far.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ng, n, s, alpha, delta = 0.02 , 0.02, 1, 0.5, 0.03\nx0 = 0.25\nxmin, xmax = 0, 2\n\ndef graph(g, n, s, alpha, delta, k):\n    return  s * k**alpha - (n+g+delta) * k\n\ndef plot45():\n    xgrid = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 12000)\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n    ax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax)\n\n    graph_values = graph(g, n, s, alpha, delta, xgrid)\n\n    ymin, ymax = np.min(graph_values), np.max(graph_values)\n    ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)\n\n    lb = r'$\\dot{k}_{t} = sk^{\\alpha} - (n+g+\\delta)k$'\n    ax.plot(xgrid, graph_values,  lw=2, alpha=0.6, label=lb)\n    ax.plot(xgrid, xgrid, 'k-', lw=1, alpha=0.7, label='$45^{\\circ}$')\n\n    ax.legend(loc='upper left', frameon=False, fontsize=12)\n\n    circle_rad = 30\n    ax.set_xticks((0, 1, 2))\n    ax.set_yticks((0, 1, 2))\n    ax.annotate(r'$\\dot{k}^{*}_{t} = (\\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta })^{(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha})}$',\n     xy=(0.873, 0.873), xytext=(0.3, 1), arrowprops=dict(\n                arrowstyle='simple,tail_width=0.3,head_width=0.8,head_length=0.8',\n                facecolor='b', shrinkB=circle_rad * 1.2),fontsize=15)\n    ax.set_xlabel('$k_t$', fontsize=12)\n    ax.set_ylabel('$k_{t+1}$', fontsize=12)\n\n    plt.show()\n\n\nplot45()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo \\(k^{*}\\) is the steady state which means what ? At that point net investment and net depreciation are equal so the net change in \\(k\\) is zero. On the flipside if we start at the right most side of the graph where \\(k_0=2\\) what will happen ? Net depreciation will be more than net investment which will force \\(k\\) down to \\(k^{*}\\). If we start at the left most side of the graph where we can set the intial value \\(k_0=0.1\\) what will happen ? Net depreciation will be less than net investment which will push \\(k\\) up to \\(k^{*}\\) the steady state. Easy enough ? Differential equations that have steady states are fairly simple to comprehend. Depending on the initial value of \\(k_0\\) that you will choose, the system will either move up to \\(k^{*}\\) or be forced down to \\(k^{*}\\) Let us visualise this with another graph to make sure you get it. The solow model, is all about the steady state. All economies in the world have different states which they are converging to at all times.\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.rc('axes', prop_cycle=(cycler('color', list(['#00308F','#007FFF','#6F00FF','#4C516D'])) +\n                           cycler('linestyle', ['-', '--', ':', '-.'])))\n\ndef g(A, s, alpha, delta, k):\n    return A * s * k**alpha + (1 - delta) * k\n\nA, s, alpha, delta = 2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4\nx0 = np.array([.25, 1.25, 3.25])\n\nts_length = 20\nxmin, xmax = 0, ts_length\nymin, ymax = 0, 3.5\ndef simulate_ts(x0_values, ts_length):\n\n    k_star = (s * A / delta)**(1/(1-alpha))\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=[11, 5])\n    ax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax)\n    ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)\n\n    ts = np.zeros(ts_length)\n\n    # simulate and plot time series\n    for x_init in x0_values:\n        ts[0] = x_init\n        for t in range(1, ts_length):\n            ts[t] = g(A, s, alpha, delta, ts[t-1])\n        ax.plot(np.arange(ts_length), ts, '-o', ms=4, alpha=0.6,\n                label=r'$k_0=%g$' %x_init)\n    ax.plot(np.arange(ts_length), np.full(ts_length,k_star),\n            alpha=0.6, color='red', label=r'$k^*$')\n    ax.legend(fontsize=10,loc='upper right')\n\n    ax.set_xlabel(r'$t$', fontsize=14)\n    ax.set_ylabel(r'$k_t$', fontsize=14)\n\n    plt.show()\nsimulate_ts(x0, ts_length)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow this particular setup is discrete and not continuous, but it is useful if you are not used to the derivative. Do you see how the curve is changing as it is getting closer to the steady state? All the \\(k_0\\) starts as a curve and finishes when it reaches the steady state as a flat line. Why ? You should be able to answer that. If you cannot, find the answer then do not move on because I will go more advanced in the next part. Watch this and this and always remember that youtube is your friend !. For those that can understand this, let us look at the continuous version of this same process.\n\n\nShow the code\nA, s, alpha, delta = 2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4\n\ndef g_con(A, s, alpha, delta, k):\n    return A * s * k**alpha - delta * k\ndef plot_gcon(kstar=None):\n\n    k_grid = np.linspace(0, 2.8, 10000)\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=[11, 5])\n    ax.plot(k_grid, g_con(A, s, alpha, delta, k_grid), label='$f(k)$')\n    ax.plot(k_grid, 0 * k_grid, label=\"$f'(k)=0$\")\n\n    if kstar:\n        fps = (kstar,)\n\n        ax.plot(fps, 0, 'go', ms=10, alpha=0.6)\n\n\n        ax.annotate(r'$k^* = (\\frac{s}{ n+g+\\delta})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}$',\n                 xy=(kstar, 0),\n                 xycoords='data',\n                 xytext=(0, 60),\n                 textcoords='offset points',\n                 fontsize=15,\n                 arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"-&gt;\"))\n\n    ax.legend(loc='lower left', fontsize=15)\n\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"$f(k)$\",fontsize=15)\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"$f'(k)$\", fontsize=15)\n\n    ax.set_xticks((0, 1, 2, 3))\n    ax.set_yticks((-0.3, 0, 0.3))\n\n    plt.show()\nkstar = ((s * A) / delta)**(1/(1 - alpha))\nplot_gcon(kstar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the previous graph this graph is continuous and shows some salient features of the cobb-douglas production function as we discussed at the start which is diminishing returns. In the solow model the slope of capital at any time is called the Marginal Product of Capital and is abbreviated MPK. Similarly we have the Marginal Prodct of labor and it is abbreviated MPL.\n\\[ MPK = \\frac{\\partial{F(K,L)}}{\\partial{K}} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Capital}} = r \\] \\[ MPl = \\frac{\\partial{F(K,L)}}{\\partial{L}} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Labor Force}} = w \\]\nMeaning how much does output change from a given change in capital. In the cobb douglas production function, as you can see from the graph when the first unit of capital is added the MPK is infinite because of the vertical asymptote. When the last unit of capital is added the MPK is zero. Mathematically we write them as limit conditions.\n\\[\\lim_{k \\to 0} f'(k) = \\infty \\] \\[\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f'(k) = 0 \\]\nNow, so far we have left price out but we may now bring price in by going from real to nominal prices in the following fashion.\n\\[ Y\\cdot P = WL + RK \\]\nDividing by price we get\n\\[ Y = (\\frac{W}{P})L + (\\frac{R}{P})K = wL + rK \\]\nWe can now show that the real wage grows at the rate of technological progress or increases in labor productivity/efficiency \\(g\\). Define and set w equal to\n\\[ TLI = \\text{Total Labor Income} \\] \\[ L =\\text{Labor Income}\\]\nWrite the equation as a growth series and re-arrange accordingly into the fact that income grows at rate \\(n+g\\) in steady state.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{12}\nw = \\frac{TLI}{L} \\\\\n\\frac{\\dot{w}}{w} + \\frac{\\dot{L}}{L} = \\frac{\\dot{TLI}}{TLI} \\\\\n$$ n + g = \\frac{\\dot{TLI}}{TLI} $\n\\end{equation}\\]\nHowever it is also true that total income itself grows at rate \\(n+g\\) in steady state giving us the following too\n$$ n + g = $\nDo you remember the last paper and the laws you learned ? You might not have noticed yet but economies in general do not really reach their steady states ever because no economy has a marginal product of capital that is zero.",

    "text": "There is a disease in the Republic of Mauritius called clout chasing by the kids of the big name politicians who did not really do anything special for the country. Like father, Like son, Like daughter I guess. Again your parents would not understand this. They have been indoctrinated. Do not even try to convince your parents, given telling someone they have been living in a delusional world for 56 years is devastating and is bound to be met with resistance. Like the uselessness of race and communalism, this too is something that your parents must come to terms with on their own. You cannot force someone to accept something they cannot understand, yet. They will understand it, but it will take time and most importantly they will only understand it through their own lenses. I do not possess that lense, nor do I know how to reach it. If you do, you could give it a shot, but I would just leave it alone.\nSo, the first thing is to separate the founding fathers of the country and their kids. I have nothing against SSR, SAJ and DUVAL. They did not do anything particularly important than any other Mauritian did not do during their lifetime, but they also never let this country turn into the degenerate fuck fest it is today, where everybody is stealing the state’s resources left and right. Which is basically the same thing that happened with the previous government. The old timers, ironically wanted what was best for their country but were simply unequipped, to be able to do anything for their country. They could not afford to be as kind as they had hoped to be. They played their part as best as they could but we need to be honest here. They had no clue what they were doing, besides securing their self interest at all times. So, naturally, like any father, they gladly stole from the state so that their family’s future was guaranteed. Who would not, with the laws that we had back then? Stealing was free back then. Without any risk. This is what eventually brought the country to its knees, in the 1980’s. Like today, back then, the buck was again passed onto anything that moves. But the cause of the country’s collapse back then was as simple as it is today. Mismanagement of our resources by the politicians and elites of the country. They of course, got around it just fine by lying back then and today. But in doing that they condemened this country to this future, it now must deal with. They paved the way for their kids to become the way they are today, a reflection of them. They protected their kids when they commited crimes for which they never served time. They showed their kids, this country is the one place where they can do whatever they wanted. They stole and stole and stole. All they needed do to get around it was to lie. People knew no better, education was nowhere to be seen back then.\nThey looked down on the population of the Republic of Mauritius. You could not live with yourself otherwise. The guilt of lying to the population everday would kill you. Eat you alive. You would kill yourself. You could not lie so much to someone you loved. Only someone you looked down on. Someone, you had no respect for. They looked down on you as slaves, that exist so they can live good lives, and rationalised their actions. I am sorry to be so honest with you but this is not a choice. If you are incompetent, you simply cannot afford kindness. It is you or them. If you choose them, you oust yourself as an incompetent. No politician has ever done that. So their kids did the same things as well. Just like most of the world looked at people of the lower class, back in the day. They are not different. They are just human beings. Either they are competent enough to be kind to you or incompetent enough that they are forced to enslave you and look down on you. So that is why, their kids lie so much today. Plenty of proof out there for the curious ones, but a striking one is a video online, where a politician that was kicked from the ruling party says that the older people are just a bunch of suckers. The irony is that they destroyed themselves with that one. All the mainstream politicians think of you as suckers. Proof of that is in what the political game has turned into. A bidding war. Offering you money when inflation has been so high but thinking ‘’these suckers would never know, all I have to do is fake the inflation, and they would vote me’’. In other words.1\nThis is what the politics of this country has turned into.2 Their actions made you this poor, increased inequality this much and yet they dare act as if they are doing you a favor. Is that all your worth ? A few worthless rupees in 2024. Can’t really blame them though, they cannot afford to do anything else. They do not know anything else. Lying is all they have. Lying is their bread and butter. Lying got them so far. They are naked dumbducks without it. To be honest with you what is happening in Mauritius is surreal. I am not saying, this does not happen everywhere in the world, it does. But the surreal part is the word democracy. This country for some reason is deemed a full democracy when it has no free market, no free competition, no liquid capital markets so that talent can freely emerge, no robust infrastructure for securitization, a pathetic capital market that cannot even link mortgages to treasuries or overnight rates. A country that has only had two prime ministers with a brief special appearance of a third. Democracy? Where buddy? Where? How the fuck did these people get to where they are? How many people did they kill exactly? They cannot be kind, they must have killed thousands by now indirectly with all that drug trade. Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware of this? How long will you go on with this charade? For what? A few bank notes here and there?",

    "text": "There is a disease in the Republic of Mauritius called clout chasing by the kids of the big name politicians who sadly could not achieve much and so must rely on their good father’s name even though they did not accomplish much too but unlike them their legacy is ‘’purer’‘. That is because the illusion that they did’‘everything’’ is still very much intact and strong. Again your parents would not understand this. They have been indoctrinated. Do not even try to convince your parents, given telling someone they have been living in a delusional world for 56 years is devastating and is bound to be met with resistance. Like the uselessness of race and communalism, this too is something that your parents must come to terms with on their own. You cannot force someone to accept something they cannot understand, yet. They will eventually understand it, while some never will. That is the power of indoctrination for you. By design, it is only useful to make someone become more and more closed off about the real nature of things. To be less and less disagreeable. That is why it is a fan favorite among dictatorships in human history.\nSo, the first thing we should do is separate the founding fathers of the country and their kids. I have nothing against them. They did not do anything particularly important than any other Mauritian did not do during their lifetime, but they also never let this country turn into the degenerate fuck fest it is today, where everybody is stealing the state’s resources left and right. Which is basically the same thing that happened with the previous government. The old timers, ironically wanted what was best for their country but were simply unequipped, to be able to do anything for their country. They could not afford to be as kind as they had hoped to be. They played their part as best as they could but we need to be honest here. They had no clue what they were doing, besides securing their self interests at all times. So, naturally, like any father, they gladly stole from the state so that their family’s future was guaranteed. Who would not, with the laws that we had back then? Stealing was free back then. Without any risk. This is what eventually brought the country to its knees, in the 1980’s. Like today, back then, the buck was again passed onto anything that moves. But the cause of the country’s collapse back then was as simple as it is today. Mismanagement of our resources by the politicians and elites of the country. They of course, got around it just fine by lying back then and today. But in doing that they condemened this country to this future, it now must deal with. They paved the way for their kids to become the way they are today, a reflection of them. They protected their kids when they commited crimes for which they never served time. They showed their kids, this country is the one place where they can do whatever they wanted. They stole and stole and stole. All they needed do to get around it was to lie. People knew no better, education was nowhere to be seen back then.\nThey looked down on the population of the Republic of Mauritius. You could not live with yourself otherwise. The guilt of lying to the population everday would kill you. Eat you alive. You would kill yourself. You could not lie so much to someone you loved. Only someone you looked down on. Someone, you had no respect for. They looked down on you as ‘things’, that exist so they can live good lives, and rationalised their actions. I am sorry to be so honest with you but this is not a choice. If you are incompetent, you simply cannot afford kindness. It is you or them. If you choose them, you oust yourself as an incompetent. No politician has ever done that. So their kids did the same things as well. Just like most of the world looked at people of the lower class, back in the day, as non humans — slaves. They are not different. They are just human beings. Either they are competent enough to be kind to you or incompetent enough that they are forced to enslave you and look down on you. So that is why, their kids lie so much today. Plenty of proof out there for the curious ones, like the one where someone makes racist remarks about the allocation of houses for the NHDC but a striking one is a video online, where a politician that was kicked from the ruling party says that the older people are just a bunch of suckers. The irony is that they destroyed themselves with that one. All the mainstream politicians think of you as suckers. Proof of that is in what the political game has turned into. A bidding war. Offering you money when inflation has been so high but thinking ‘’These suckers would never know, all I have to do is fake the inflation, and they would vote me’’. In other words, in their heads it goes something like this.1\nThis is what the politics of this country has turned into.2 Their actions made you this poor, increased inequality this much and yet they dare act as if they are doing you a favor. Is that all your worth ? A few worthless rupees in 2024. Can’t really blame them though, they cannot afford to do anything else. They do not know anything else. Lying is all they have. Lying is their bread and butter. Lying got them so far. They are naked dumbducks without it. To be honest with you what is happening in Mauritius is surreal. I am not saying, this does not happen everywhere in the world, it does. But the surreal part is the word democracy. This country for some reason is deemed a full democracy when it has no free market, no free competition, no liquid capital markets so that talent can freely emerge, no robust infrastructure for securitization, a pathetic capital market that cannot even link mortgages to treasuries or overnight rates. A country that has only had two prime ministers with a brief special appearance of a third. Democracy? Where buddy? Where? How the fuck did these people get to where they are? How many people did they kill exactly over 56 years? They cannot be kind, they must have killed thousands by now indirectly with all that drugs trade. Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware of this? How long will you go on with this charade? For what? A few bank notes here and there? Everyday a new family is destroyed so these people can afford to fund their election campaigns. So these people can afford to buy things to gift you to win general elections. Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware, they give tax money willy nilly to a small group of people because they expect a large cut of it back? Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware that they use public money to do their electoral campaigns? Are we supposed to act as if we give a fuck about them when they give not a fuck about us circa 1968? Are we supposed to let this kind of insolence go unanswered? Where is the respect? Can’t even steal discreetly and ingeniously can you?",
