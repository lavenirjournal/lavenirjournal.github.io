<p>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall be above one thousand rupees, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of Mauritius, than according to the rules of the common law.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<p>Section 7</p>
</div>
<p>Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.</p>

<p>Section 8</p>
</div>
<p>No person shall be convicted or punished in cases where the only proof against him is his own confession.^[ This The path ahead is not easy, because we will inevitably need to ask for help in the future, the current situation is much worse than that of the 1980s because of the amount of debt that hangs over our heads and our children’s heads, we will need financial assistance from the IMF and to get it the IMF will logically demand that we increase our potential output growth rate. To do that we will need to bring our RER down. To bring our RER down? Ding Ding Ding, we will inevitably need to devaluate our currency. Now we will also need to fiscally consolidate to rebuild a capital base that will form our basis of investment so that we can take 2 to 3 steps back to be able to take a much bigger leap forward. That is how it works always, the first few years are the hardest, because you need to cut consumption to increase your savings, but fairly quickly you’ll be able to get to a much higher level of consumption that way. The government will still do everything it can to support you. But pensions will not move anymore, you have to realise that you got played hard, and you never got anything, they increased your pension on one side and printed money on the other side, effectively giving you a whole of disrespect but not much else in reality. If there is a need for it, adequate nutrition is essential for all children so they can not only grow up healthy but live to their fullest potential be it education-wise, sports-wise or anything else. So, I will consider doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program">SNAP</a> locally because it has too much literature going for it to deny its objective need to exist everywhere in the world, but that is it. That is potentially all the help you will be getting from the government in the future. I am not going to lie to you. I am not going to lie to conglomerates either. Forget every subsidy you have gotten from the current government. Stop expecting the state to be your daddy from now on. Get good to continue enjoying the privilege that god bestowed upon you or get lost, I need you to have a real presence on world markets. Real presence that stems from this country, and brings in foreign currency through production. I do not care who the fuck it will be, whoever does it will receive a lot of support from the government at any scale. Cutthroat capitalism is what this country will turn into. The best will get everything. If you feel like you are the best, then what are so scared of?</p>
<p>We need to put a pin on Real Estate for now, and anything that has to do with services and ‘beton’ in general. Besides healthcare reform where I will bring national health insurance in and we will do away with this ‘free health-care’ propaganda, services are just not something we can care about for now. I like South Korea’s system of National Health Insurance and their way of working with the private sector. I do not like free stuff. Free stuff breeds complacency and an attitude where you do not feel the need to understand things. You are just given stuff in your lap basically which I do not like. I want people to feel like they have a right to complain to hospitals and want to empower them to be able to keep their public hospitals in check. To do that, you have to get rid of the propaganda word ‘FREE’. Free generally means poor quality. Nothing is free. Now is that your experience of it too? So we get rid of it and rather start inculcating responsibility into our own. We need to encourage people to assert their rights when they pay for it. Have you ever noticed, that we are a very passive bunch? All of that passiveness strems from free and things falling into people’s lap.</p>
<p>Leaving that aside, the only focus is to have a real industrial base. A capital intensive industrial base. How do we do that? That is a two-fold challenge. Of which the first is domestic demand, because we do have not a lot of it clustered around here. But it is not doomed either, madagascar and reunion are a few hours away. We must pull these countries up by trading with them more and more and more. We must lobby France extensively in that it could be part of the African core if only it encouraged more people to move to Reunion and that there is a lot of tax and output to be had there. A lot. If between reunion and us, there were at least ~10-12 million people, and we added madagascar to that as well. We fucking won. That is it. We are extremely safe from any conflict that will happen in the world because we have India, the US and France watching our backs. We are the safest place to do business in Africa for the next 100 years. Supply-side costs will only decrease with a competent government. We will however need to do good on our commitment to a few things, for the manufacturing to come. First is a commitment to population growth. Second is a commitment to free trade, maximum competition, and cutthroat capitalism. Third is a commitment to a stable democracy with sound government finances. Fourth is a commitment to find a pool of highly skilled workers. Number Fourth is by far the biggest challenge because we are dumb. We need some kind of free trade agreement with an advanced economy that has labor mobility eased into it so we can tap into a pool of highly skilled workers to develop a capital-intensive industrial base reliably. Eventually, it would also help us develop the financial side of it after all this is said and done. That is step two though and is a long way ahead. There are many ways to try to coerce the world to come here, but I am not going to write each one down. I gave you the deterministic win condition. If we achieve it, then we will become the core of Africa. That should be enough of a plan for you for now. Do you want to help? Go empower yourself. Learn and understand the universe you live in as much as you can. Then be the change you want to see in this world. That is how you help..]</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Due process of law does not currently exist in the Republic of Mauritius. For example, arbitrary arrests frequently do not proceed to the next legal step required by law, which is the right to the presence of a counsel for legal assitance. They rather proceed to the intimidation step by violating the due process of law. This is a simple example that has been perpetuated for 56 years with ‘Ti-Dimoune’ and enemies of government’s in power.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p> This will end ICTA’s reign of terror.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This will end the SST’s reign of terror.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn8"><p>I will transition the MBC to a PBS style educative focused television channel. We will also focus on creating TV shows that espouses our history in French and English and do our best to export it. We can create a lot of colonial fiction for example and sell it to both the UK market and the French market. I am sure there are talented screen writers in the country.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
