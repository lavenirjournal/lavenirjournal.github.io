<section id="the-disgusting-truth" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-disgusting-truth">The Disgusting Truth</h2>
<p>Like most of you, I have lived my entire life in the Republic of Mauritius. Over the years though, there are some disturbing things that I have found out, about this country we all call home. The elites in the private sector and the public sector are legitimately the dumbest people I have ever seen in my life. They rely on the rest of the population as their crutch, to make up for their incredible amount of incompetence. That has led the Republic of Mauritius to be a country of mediocrity, that after 56 years of independence is completely stuck because these dumbducks are holding it back. The country we live in is not progressing anymore. It has not progressed at all for years. This country’s elites are so incompetent, that the government is willingly encouraging people to leave their own home, by making their lives harder and facilitating more imports of foreign workers in every sector, because they are much easier to exploit. It is akin to hitting two birds with one stone, given they also push people, who in all likelihood would not vote for them. Everybody knows that the imported labor is underpaid and overworked. Do you understand, how unkind these people at the top are? They would do it to you too, if labor laws were not here to protect you. They are conspiring with the government literally to push you away from your home. From your place of birth because they are too incompetent. So with you, they have to change tunes. They will gaslight you, and scream you are lazy, they will demean you, and scream that you are apparently a bum — When the bitter truth is that they cannot afford to pay you a decent living wage because their costs would increase too much and they would go bankrupt. Because of their own incompetence, not yours. They need slaves to compensate for their incompetence. Slaves to exploit. These are horrible people. These people will never stop. This has been going on for 56 years and it will go on for 56 more unless you stand up.</p>
<p>It’s not like this country lacks competence today. There are very competent people waiting on the sidelines, to be able to get the opportunity to help their country. You, the young people of the Republic of Mauritius, who eagerly await for someone to recognize your talent and reward you for your true worth. You need to accept that you need someone competent to be able to do that. That is never going to happen, in the current Mauritius. Unfortunately, kindness, in and of itself does not actually exist. What exists is competence. You can only be as kind as you are competent in this world. A dumbduck, on the other hand, cannot be kind. We are in a very messed up situation to be honest. You have a country filled with undeserving, incompetent people shamelessly hogging all its wealth and bullying the rest of the population. These people have bankrupted the country repeatedly over the past 56 years. At this point, I know too much to turn a blind eye. I am competent enough you see, to not need anybody currently in either the private sector or the public sector. I am more interested, in a Mauritius that does massive semiconductors manufacturing. Cars manufacturing. Electronics manufacturing. In letting a multinational like Intercontinental Exchange, open a clearing house here called ICE Africa, to establish Mauritius as the core of Africa in Finance. I am interested, in a Mauritius whose population is closer to ~6-8 million rather than the 1.4 million it currently is. I am not interested in the periphery Mauritius, that you come to, when you need to set up some funds here, to evade taxes or launder some dollars that you steal from your people’s home country as a statesman. In the periphery Mauritius you come to do textiles manufacturing. I am simply not interested in menial labor intensive manufacturing which is what we currently do. I am simply not interested in the Mauritius that exists today. It is disgusting. It is literal hell. All it does is exploit, exploit, exploit. It is a prison. It is all it claims not to be. I am not interested in the dumbducks or their future, wealth or prosperity. I could not give less of a fuck about protecting their interests. I am interested in you, the young people. The unused talent of this country. The STEM and non-STEM majors. I am interested in you, the future of the Republic of Mauritius. Because I cannot do this alone. I need you, the competent people to take a stand. Together, we can rebuild this country.</p>
<p>But you must understand, the very conundrum that this poses for the dumbducks. You see while the dumbducks are a rare breed, because there is so few of them. They control a large part of the country. A few families control more than 65% of the entire economy of the Kingdom of Mauritius. Thing is, this country is not the free market it so likes to claim. This country is tailor made for a group people. So tailor-made, that the government had to literally destroy a conglomerate called British American Investment, to prevent it from becoming the leading conglomerate of the Republic of Mauritius. The only smart duck in town that was killed off. This is how tailor-made this country is. You are really in a fancy prison, if you are educated enough to see through the facade, that the dumbducks have set up. The majority of the people in politics in this country are families and related. Almost all of them have never brought anything to the table besides history, or the fact that they were related. They practice a modern form of inbreeding to keep their inner circle small because only two political parties have sway in the country. They both use race to do politics. Really, when you look at it objectively, Mauritius is just the Europe of the 1780’s-1800’s. It is an abomination that must end. And It will end. What has started here, signals the end of the monarchy of mauritius. Where all the laws, are carefully drafted so that the chosen elites have zero competitors and enjoy monopolies. Where trademark laws or what is known as patent exhaustion is carefully made so you cannot be a competitor to someone representing a brand from abroad. How is this a free market? It is not. It is just one of the many many lies the country perpetuates. Lots of crazy propaganda in this country, one, I remember, that was popular when I was young – is that it is the only country in the world where education and health were free. Your parents believed that lie. Even my parents believed that lie. But that is all it ever was. Lies. We call it propaganda. Propaganda exists to manipulate uneducated people. To mould them into obedient sheep. Slaves. Truth is, most countries have socialist policies. All this country has ever really done is copy laws from other countries. Truth is parallel imports would have done much more for you than free healthcare ever did. But you cannot know that can you, because you listen to their bullshit and take it as gospel.</p>
<p>The truth is they lie, and that is all they do. They are good at it. That is the only thing they excel at. I guess stealing public money is another thing most of them excel at. They make shit up to seem competent. They will pay a shit ton of money to get into a university, earn a piece of paper to fake their competence. But cannot even use an excel sheet. They are so insecure that they will abuse their authority over the police to bully you if you ever are a threat to them. Things are so bad that these days, some outright fake the fact that they do not even have the qualifications they claim. They fake the paper altogether rather than just faking their competence. That is how incompetent our country has become after 56 years. Unfortunately, because our parents were not given the chance to have the education we have been offered, they bought these lies for 56 years. They could not see through these phonies. They thought, that these people were the best of the country. That they are competent. A lot of people actually believe that. That some politicians have saved our country. That they are the reason Mauritius progressed. You cannot hold it against your parents, to have been sucked in communalism propaganda. You cannot even hold it against yourself if you have been sucked in communalism propaganda for that matter. This is your chance to change though. Unlike your parents who are probably too far gone. To be fair, everybody got sucked in from that generation. They got sucked in because they could not know better. They were denied an education. This was their education. To be racist. They were indoctrinated, by the politics of the Republic of Mauritius for 56 years. Most old people in the Republic of Mauritius are extremely racist. You should however never hold it against them. They did not choose to be racist. They were forced to be racists. We would all be racists too, had we been given the same education our parents and grandparents were given which was not one. It was a school of propaganda. Of castes. Of religious hate. Of sowing the seeds of discord and violence. Of encouraging discrimination. It is how disgusting, the politics of that generation was and still is to this day. Their definition of what democracy is, is therefore colored by all that indoctrination. <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/north-east-asia/korean-peninsula/north-korean-style-democracy-and-prospects-true-democratisation">Just like the definition of democracy to most North Koreans is to have a supreme leader that controls everything, because they are indoctrinated to believe that.</a></p>
<p>For all those reasons, it is unlikely that your parents would understand any of this. Because they are victims, in all of this, who have been abused by politics for 56 years and they do not even know it. They do not have the required education to be able to process all of this. They cannot understand that, they have been lied to, played with, by religion for 56 long years while the resources of the country were mismanaged by all the governments. Just like they cannot understand that the government is fooling them by using printed central bank money to increase their pension which will only increase the cost of living and make their life harder, not easier. You should never hold it against them. They do not know. But government knows, they are fooling them. That is what you should be focusing on. The disprespect this government has for the elderly. I would like to be very clear. Yes, the current government will go down as the worst in the history of the country but other governments stole too by funneling public money into their close circle’s bank accounts by being intermediaries rather than just service providers on all tenders that the government puts out. Do not be stupid, by thinking there was a ‘’good government’’. Good governments, do not exist in this world. That is why laws exist. Good laws are what the Republic of Mauritius needs. Nobody has done anything though for 56 long years, because they all enjoyed stealing the resources of the country when it was their turn to bat. Everybody has stolen money. You live in a country where the top companies have continuously gone bust for over 56 years, only to be given your hard-earned money so they can do it all over again. That is the law of nature of the Republic of Mauritius. In it, you are a prisoner if you are not born, in some select families. If you do not somehow suck up, to the right person, suck some bick if you are extremely unlucky, your ambitions will always have ceilings. Competence is irrelevant in this country. Because dumbducks do not have it. And they set the rules. So, to you the people of competence. You have to change the game. That is the only option.</p>

<section id="the-monarchy-of-mauritius" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-monarchy-of-mauritius">The Monarchy of Mauritius</h2>
<p>In essence, what has been happening in Mauritius for 56 years is what was happening in Europe when Kings and Queens ruled. The monarchy was filled with dumbducks. They had to put their people through increasingly more and more misery, as time went on, the more they let them rule and bully them. It is literal hell these days if you are someone young looking at what the Republic of Mauritius is turning into. The smugness of dumbducks who knows they only got what they got because of privilege is killing this country. The abuse that everyone around them must endure in their workplace is ridiculous. The monarch of Mauritius are experts at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Mauritius">how to magically and shamelessly forget they stole public money and how both political parties allow the import of all the drugs in the country</a>. The most ridiculous thing about all of this, is that they believe they are fooling you, like they fooled your parents for fifty six years. They are arrogant as fuck. They are killing people literally with all the drugs they import. They think you do not know, it is them. That both parties have dabbled in it at some point in the last 56 years at the very least. It is so disrespectful, to think this lowly of the young people of this country. I do not even understand, how these people can show their faces everyday, come on camera and talk the shit they do. Do you hear yourself? Do you have dementia or something? I am genuinely impressed at this level of shamelessness, I have to admit. But this should be proof to you that they will not stop bullying you and killing the children of this country until you do something about it. These people literally don’t give a fuck about anything but their pockets.</p>
<p>There are a lot competent people today in the Republic of Mauritius. But they do not come from the right family. The right political party. They do not come from the right race. They do not come from the right caste. They do not come from the right skin color. In the past, all these things, these made up bullshit arbitrary rules, like caste, religions were used to brainwash your parents, to divide this country, so that the dumbducks could rule. Politicians made this country more and more racist because it was the only way for them to win for 56 years by pitting you against each other. By dividing us into castes, religions, and forcing us to recognize how we are different from each other rather than embracing how we are all alike. It is a pity that religion sided with them for some money under the table. Using god for your own selfish and disgusting interest? Like politician, like religious leader. Must be nice. To have the ability to be so shameless. However, we do not have to continue with that tradition of doing politics with race and religion. I have no need for it. I am religious person who actively practices and respects god. I personally would not mind legislating so it is impossible to do politics with religion hereon. As for race, that is up to you to hold your politicians to a better standard onwards. Come on now, this is for the best, for the whole country. We want meaningfull, educated speeches from politicians. The trash should sort itself out of politics if such a law is passed. I am hoping with your help, we can truly turn a new leaf, where we will live by new rules. Principally, of letting education finally do its job. Of allowing competence to bloom. There is no other way. We need the most competent to be given the opportunity to become the richest in this country. So the most competent can make this country an advanced economy with their hard work. The first step is to do that is to understand the prison you live in, so as to not repeat your parents’ choices for 56 years that have shaped your own destiny, to bring you here. Helpless, with no future. Do you want your own child to go through this kind of abuse tomorrow again 56 years in the future ? Then it is time to stop the bullies.</p>
<p>Your parents could not understand these simple truths because they have been brainwashed. They cannot understand that American presidents have in no way shaped the success of America like its people and its immigrants. They cannot understand this bitter truth, that is nonetheless true — That The Republic of Mauritius has only been held back by its politicians for 56 years. All of them have misused the resources of this country. They have condemned it by their actions to become as poor as it did today. That is simple cause and effect. Basic science, your parents cannot understand. Dumbducks have condemned your life to become so hard. And it will only get harder, each extra day you allow them to bully you. The dumbducks are the source of all your misery not all your success like your parents have been brainwashed to believe. That is what all these politicians and private sector people really are. Bullies, who use the state’s resources to their leisure. I wish they were geniuses and competent people. My life would be easier. Your life would be easier. You think Microsoft and Nvidia managers complain that Bill Gates and Jensen Huang were too competent that they made them millionaires over night? Nobody would complain if the dumbducks were competent, not even me. Our lives would be so much easier. They are not though. But you are. You are competent and among you there are geniuses. You could replace these people, if you were good enough, easily in a free market. I will make this country a completely free market so that anyone can take on any conglomerate and actually WIN if they are better than them.</p>

<section id="appealing-the-heavens" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appealing-the-heavens">Appealing The Heavens</h2>
<p>Now here is the thing, either you put an end to the bullying, via elections before it’s too late. Or we will eventually go into a revolution at some point in the future. It is as simple as that. The country has been bankrupt for a long time now. No political party coming into power will change that fact. There is no magic ingredient. To stop this, you need to acknowledge this does not work. What has been done for 56 years never worked. That’s a fact. Not an opinion. Repeatedly, the country went bust, which is why there were devaluations each time, like right now. The country went bust because state resources went into the bank accounts of politicians and their closed circles. Who simply stole your tax money and increased your suffering. Every time they stole, they diluted the real wealth of the country. Your wealth had to decrease, for theirs to increase. You do not have much wealth left today. Do you understand, why all revolutions happen? People do not simply wake up wanting to kill their state leaders. It is years of suffering that has been bottled up that explodes.</p>
<p>Which is why, I need you to understand what you are getting yourself into right now. This is a fight for freedom. For liberty, to end the opression of the monarchy of Mauritius once and for all. What is happening in Mauritius is not an isolated event. It is happening all over the world. This is what always happens. Human beings are pieces of shit. It is human nature. Some are competent pieces of shit. Some are incompetent pieces of shit. I am a competent piece of shit. You are most likely a competent piece of shit too. They are not. Do you think the United States has no corruption? Every country has A LOT of corruption. It is just how things are. It is sad certainly. But it speaks volume of human nature. The country that progresses though, has competent people in the private sector to compensate for their dumbducks, in the public sector and they have laws that work. You are allowed to steal, but if you get caught stealing, tough luck. You played and lost. Go to prison now, do the time. We have nothing. No working laws. We have dumbducks in both sectors. Today, Mauritius finds itself in a situation where it is actually riskfree to steal given nothing will happen given there is no justice anymore. Nothing works. There is nothing left in this country. It is possibly the worst banana republic on earth. Everything is controlled by the Prime Minister, like a King once had control in Europe. That is why the country is sliding at a much faster pace than before. There is no discipline when everybody knows there will be no consequences because the rule of law is dead.</p>
<p>So remember, if you are in, this is our fight, not our parent’s fight. Your parents cannot understand. Mine cannot either. You might think, well that is weird. But it is exactly how revolutions happen. People who are not indoctrinated or who are very educated are the people who participate in it. That means young and older educated people. American Revolutionaries were from these two groups joining forces alone. Have you ever read the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">United States Declaration of Independence?</a>. You really should. You will see all the similarities that the then Great Britain had with the current Kingdom of Mauritius. I need you to understand and accept that you live in a country with zero democracy, on your own. With a King, who is unleashing his tyranny and needs to be stopped at all costs. Please do not commit to a fight you do not believe in. Just do not do that ever. You have to be in this for you. For your future after you can recognize that it no longer exists right now in our current Mauritius. Do not join a movement like this on a whim. This is not a game. Read everything that I have written. Not just this paper, read all papers, and learn the whole truth of what has been actually happening in your country for the last ten years. Then make your decision.</p>

<p>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.</p>

<p>You see, appealing the heavens is a serious thing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke">John Locke</a> used it a metaphor to explain how every human being has the right of revolution whenever they are denied their natural rights which are life, liberty and their pursuit of happiness by their ruler or state. You are being denied those things heavily in Mauritius today as I will be showing you in the other papers. Those rights are natural rights, in that they supersede any man made law. As for the literal meaning of appealing the heavens, the last passage of the declaration expounds what it means. It means to let god decide who is worthy of winning. The United States appealed to a higher power in their declaration telling god, you choose the winner buddy. We think what great britain is doing is wrong and we are prepared to bet our lives on it to fight for our liberty and our pursuit of happiness. The United States never wanted to go that far, they were forced to go that far by Britain denying them their Independence.</p>

<p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>

<p>The truth is this country was never fought for, not in 1968, not ever. The UK was royally fucked, when they lost India. They had no more bodies to send to die in colonies to further their oppression. After the Algerian war, it was simply a bad political choice to hold on to colonies, unless you had non-voting bodies to throw at them. You would lose elections which is why, the UK let go as did France of its colonies. Now, you want to thank someone. Thank all the people, who bravely fought and died for your freedom in the Algerian revolution, because they are the real cause, the entire African continent, finally got liberated. That is a fact buddy. Again not an opinion. Simple cause and effect. All our representatives ensured is that we would one day become a banana republic. That this day would come. That is a bad way to ensure democracy if you ask me. Especially when the original way of handling elections, which the British proposed included proportional representation. That would have done more than anyone has ever for the past 56 years, to ensure democracy in this country, but we did not want democracy, so we forced first past the post on a country of uneducated people and a pseudo proportional representation based on raciality. To make race and communalism the game for 56 years. ON PURPOSE. They simply did not give a fuck about you then and neither do they now. They got what they wanted. Power and access to the state’s resources for 56 years. What do you want? Anybody ever ask you that in 56 years?</p>
<p>I write this anonymously for a simple purpose. I wish to end this here, all by my lonesome by convincing you with good old reason and maths. Not with war, not with a revolution. I am a complete nobody and that is fine with me for now atleast. It is why I can afford to be so real with you. The magic of the internet, and anonymity over it. I will vote for the labour party in the coming elections and if you wish to show support of me, I hope you will vote the labour party as well. I know, the labour party is not great. I get that even the labour party steals. I get that the labour party has not been very different from the other party who ‘ruled’ this country. I cannot do anything about the past of the labour party, nor do I wish to destroy the heritage of this country. I think our country has a great heritage. Perfection is not a real thing. It is time you opened your eyes to the real world and stopped living in a delusional one. This is what happens in all countries, not just in Mauritius. The horror which the politicians hide from you as well as the good which they will always exacerbate because they are talking of their fathers’ (as they should). Both are important things to remember so we do not repeat the same mistakes over and over. Honestly, it does not bother me if you think of this country’s fathers fondly. As you should, they were ultimately good people with flaws. Just do not dare forget their flaws.</p>
<p>I would like to make a true democractic country where anybody will be able to head the Second Republic. We can only break this taboo, if we make the head of state a president rather than a prime minister. Where everybody goes to the polls to vote one guy or girl. That is the only way to break the taboo of communalism. It will not happen overnight, but it will happen eventually. All it takes is a competent woman or man from any minority group to step forward and prove his dedication to the population. I unfortunately am from the majority hindu group but I am sure, that a potential and competent President from a minority will show up eventually, one day. My vision of the Second Republic does not have a presidential mandate limit. A president is elected for 6 years. The president will have his own cabinet or administration. The president will have the task to make a budget proposal to the house every year, who will need to discuss it and vote on it. There will be no prime minister. We are not that big a country to need it. The president is the head of government and of the state. The country will have parliamentary elections every three years instead of the current five so people may actively show if they have confidence in their president’s party. We will not have a senate, we do not have the population for that. Most important nominations will come from the president and will be handled by committes of parliament ultimately requiring 2/3 bipartisanship, so as to safeguard against despotism. Bills will require a small bipartisanship effort most times with them requiring 3/5 votes to pass to the president for signing. Presidents will be able to veto any bill that passes that way unless the president is countered with a 2/3 vote of parliament.</p>
<p>I want to completely decentralise police powers to districts and have them co-operate with a state department (who will keep districts in check) that is heavily regulated by parliament, free from any presidential control besides nominating an independent head (by law) which will need to be accepted by parliament. By law parliament can make the acceptance of nominations as hard as parliament wants it to be able to safeguard democracy because they will be in total control. Same thing can be done with Central Bank Governors. These things are set by law, not by the president. So, parliament will be more powerful that the president in this setting and will actively be able to put checks and balances on him, so the president cannot do whatever he wants. The president will no longer make the law, unlike the prime minister now who is a King, he will merely carry out laws passed by parliament, meaning he will ‘’take care that the Laws be faithfully executed’‘. I want a bill of rights, that kills reasonable suspicion for arbitrary arrests that are used for the intimidation of the population currently and want to finally bring in probable cause as the correct standard. I want a country that severly reprimands a police officer for planting drugs into the home of an innocent civilian, by making him lose his state pension should he be found guilty of such an accusation in a court of law. I want to make it compulsory to not only educate our kids about their <a href="../constitution/preamble.html">new consitution</a>, but I want us to take maths extremely seriously as a country. I want education to be compulsory until you are 18 or can pass a hard enough maths test to leave highschool. I have no desire to keep our kids stupid. I want us to be honest with our kids about the fact that their past leaders stole, had flaws, were imperfect, and that this a natural thing that happens everywhere in the world, and yet it is okay to be proud of them if they so wish, if only for their contribution to the development of their nation. I want us to be real with our kids unlike the last 56 years. They are our future. This is the kind of leader, that I want to be for the labour party and the Second Republic of Mauritius. I cannot say whether the labour party will accept me or not. I am tending an olive branch to them, so they may keep their place in history along with their fathers’ history. If they are smart enough, they will take it. If they are not, I’ll eventually create something new, and wipe the slate clean completely if the support for such a Republic is here.</p>
<p>After all, what I want and what you probably want as well, is what no party has wanted for 56 years. Real independence. Real democracy. For the Kingdom of Mauritius to become finally and permanently become The Republic of Mauritius by giving it a real system of checks and balances where each branch of government can actually keep the other in check. That is the real challenge for our country. To make a system that can outlast me and anybody that comes. To not fall into the despostism we have been entrenched and stuck in for the last 56 years. To make a system that will resist even the most crooked president our country might one day have. Our current one did not. We are completely broke as a country.</p>
<p>In any circumstances, appealing the heavens is a terrible thing and I wish to avoid it at all costs. It is not kind. But I am simply being real with you as to what is potentially ahead. I am resolved to do what must be done if it comes to it. You must be prepared for this eventuality too, if it comes to it, if you want to partake in this fight for the country’s independence. I sincerely hope I alone am enough. It is possible that with enough popular support, that I alone will be enough. Whether war comes however, is not on me or you. I have not been Prime minister of the Monarchy of Mauritius for 56 years. You have not either. What comes is on them. These successive governments for 56 years. That is valid for the entire world. The dumbducks of this world caused whatever is coming by being shit governments and by stealing all the resources of their countries. Not me, not you, or even you internet foreigner who lives in another country. You think, if everything was good with Mauritius I would be here? You think you would be here, reading this article and deeply relating to it. There is a reason for all of this. That is why, I want to avoid all of this, imperatively. You the young people with your vote, can be the game-changer that allows this country to avoid not only a revolution but the game-changer that secures your future and your children’s future, which you know currently is the bleakest it has ever been.</p>
<div class="text-center center">
<p>To be honest with you this is it for me. I do not believe in free will. I am a determinist that believes that everything is determined by the laws of nature made by the Creator of the Universe. I either become your president or die trying. If die I must, then by god’s will alone will I die, happily fighting for my country’s freedom with a smile on my face.</p>
