All elected officials shall receive a Compensation with benefits for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the Republic of Mauritius.

No law, varying the compensation for the services of any elected officials, shall take effect, until the next round of election shall have intervened for the office in controversy.

All public sector workers and elected members shall have access to the same contributory pension system as provisioned by law.^[Think [FERS](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-center/fers-information/)]

Section 2
:::

No public or para-public sector job shall have discrete remuneration or raises. Rather general schedules will be created consisting of grades, steps and benefits and a single mechanic of revaluation applying to all schedules, as shall be ascertained by Law. 

Gamification principles shall be used to ascertain the skills and education each grade requires, skills being fair to man and woman.

Every public and para-public sector job shall belong to a schedule and have a grade attached to it. Steps shall be based on lengths of service. 

All forms of remuneration of elected officials shall be public as well as their pensions.

Section 3
:::

Total pension to be paid for the service of an elected official after his term ends by the state using the people's money shall be calculated using the following formulation being careful to always take highest pension $p_{h}$ to the lowest pension $p_{l}$ in the following fashion. This shall be applied on all pensions as if they always lived under such regulation.

\begin{equation} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{p=h}^{l} \frac{1}{n} p \end{equation} for $n$ starting at 1.

The base pay of the President shall be based on the median income of the top 10 domestic earners. Said number shall be discounted by 40\% and then multiplied by 2 to get the Presidential basic pay. His administration executives shall 
receive the said number discounted by 40\% as base pay.^[Courtesy of Lee Kwan Yew's Genius of how to prevent corruption, which I too am a big believer of.]
