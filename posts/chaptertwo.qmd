## Mythomania Disease

There is a disease in the Republic of Mauritius called clout chasing by the kids of the big name politicians who sadly could not achieve much and so must rely on their good father's name even though they did not accomplish much too but unlike them their legacy is ''purer''. That is because the illusion that they did  ''everything'' is still very much intact and strong. Again your parents would not understand this. They have been indoctrinated. Do not even try to convince your parents, given telling someone they have been living in a delusional world for 56 years is devastating and is bound to be met with resistance. Like the uselessness of race and communalism, this too is something that your parents must come to terms with on their own. You cannot force someone to accept something they cannot understand, yet. They will eventually understand it, while some never will. That is the power of indoctrination for you. By design, it is only useful to make someone become more and more closed off about the real nature of things. To be less and less disagreeable. That is why it is a fan favorite among dictatorships in human history.

So, the first thing we should do is separate the founding fathers of the country and their kids. I have nothing against them. They did not do anything particularly important than any other Mauritian did not do during their lifetime, but they also never let this country turn into the degenerate fuck fest it is today, where everybody is stealing the state's resources left and right. Which is basically the same thing that happened with the previous government. The old timers, ironically wanted what was best for their country but were simply unequipped, to be able to do anything for their country. They could not afford to be as kind as they had hoped to be. They played their part as best as they could but we need to be honest here. They had no clue what they were doing, besides securing their self interests at all times. So, naturally, like any father, they gladly stole from the state so that their family's future was guaranteed. Who would not, with the laws that we had back then? Stealing was free back then. Without any risk. This is what eventually brought the country to its knees, in the 1980's. Like today, back then, the buck was again passed onto anything that moves. But the cause of the country's collapse back then was as simple as it is today. Mismanagement of our resources by the politicians and elites of the country. They of course, got around it just fine by lying back then and today. But in doing that they condemened this country to this future, it now must deal with. They paved the way for their kids to become the way they are today, a reflection of them. They protected their kids when they commited crimes for which they never served time. They showed their kids, this country is the one place where they can do whatever they wanted. They stole and stole and stole. All they needed do to get around it was to lie. People knew no better, education was nowhere to be seen back then.

They looked down on the population of the Republic of Mauritius. You could not live with yourself otherwise. The guilt of lying to the population everday would kill you. Eat you alive. You would kill yourself. You could not lie so much to someone you loved. Only someone you looked down on. Someone, you had no respect for. They looked down on you as 'things', that exist so they can live good lives, and rationalised their actions. I am sorry to be so honest with you but this is not a choice. If you are incompetent, you simply cannot afford kindness. It is you or them. If you choose them, you oust yourself as an incompetent. No politician has ever done that. So their kids did the same things as well. Just like most of the world looked at people of the lower class, back in the day, as non humans --- slaves. They are not different. They are just human beings. Either they are competent enough to be kind to you or incompetent enough that they are forced to enslave you and look down on you. So that is why, their kids lie so much today. Plenty of proof out there for the curious ones, like the one where someone makes racist remarks about the allocation of houses for the NHDC but a striking one is a video online, where a politician that was kicked from the ruling party says that the older people are just a bunch of suckers. The irony is that they destroyed themselves with that one. All the mainstream politicians think of you as suckers. Proof of that is in what the political game has turned into. A bidding war. Offering you money when inflation has been so high but thinking ''These suckers would never know, all I have to do is fake the inflation, and they would vote me''. In other words, in their heads it goes something like this.^[EIN TRAPER PREND TO GOGOT LARGENT KI PENA OKEN VALER LA AHAHAHHA, ASTER DONNE MOI MO VOTE.]

This is what the politics of this country has turned into.^[UN SOU RESPECT ZOT PENA POU TOI, TORMA EK TORPA. LI VRAIMENT DEGOUTANT] Their actions made you this poor, increased inequality this much and yet they dare act as if they are doing you a favor. Is that all your worth ? A few worthless rupees in 2024. Can't really blame them though, they cannot afford to do anything else. They do not know anything else. Lying is all they have. Lying is their bread and butter. Lying got them so far. They are naked dumbducks without it. To be honest with you what is happening in Mauritius is surreal. I am not saying, this does not happen everywhere in the world, it does. But the surreal part is the word democracy. This country for some reason is deemed a full democracy when it has no free market, no free competition, no liquid capital markets so that talent can freely emerge, no robust infrastructure for securitization, a pathetic capital market that cannot even link mortgages to treasuries or overnight rates. A country that has only had two prime ministers with a brief special appearance of a third. Democracy? Where buddy? Where? How the fuck did these people get to where they are? How many people did they kill exactly over 56 years? They cannot be kind, they must have killed thousands by now indirectly with all that drugs trade. Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware of this? How long will you go on with this charade? For what? A few bank notes here and there? Everyday a new family is destroyed so these people can afford to fund their election campaigns. So these people can afford to buy things to gift you to win general elections. Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware, they give tax money willy nilly to a small group of people because they expect a large cut of it back? Are we supposed to act as if we are not aware that they use public money to do their electoral campaigns? Are we supposed to act as if we give a fuck about them when they give not a fuck about us circa 1968? Are we supposed to let this kind of insolence go unanswered? Where is the respect? Can't even steal discreetly and ingeniously can you?


## Economic Development

You should have already deduced this by now if you read the previous article, but The Kingdom of Mauritius has collapsed twice in its history. Meaning this is the second time that we have reached zero growth. The first time was in the 1980's. This brings up the obvious question. How the hell did this country ever progress to even come here? The answer is with the beauty of free trade and a lot of luck. Mauritius would have been a lot more developped than it is today had it not been held back by its bad management. You see, back in the day, Europe had a thing for colonies for some reason, and it knew just the way to bolster its relation with newly freed countries. Some free money and some preferential trade agreements to get into the good books of some African countries. Of those, Mauritius belonged to. [The Yaounde Convention, The Lome agreement for ACP countries were some of the names of the agreements but that is not the most important part](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/oacps/en/about/history). The most important part is, Mauritius got a preferential trade agreement to sell sugar in the European Common Market which the UK was part of at the time. That allowed it to build a sizeable amount of savings. Unfortunately, we had no real understanding of the world. On the advice of international economists', Mauritius tried to industrialise by increasing tarrifs as a way to force the local conglomerates to go into manufacturing to do what is called [import substitution industrialisation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import_substitution_industrialization) 

Of course, it was a lost cause, given the domestic demand of the country was a drop of water into the ocean that is world GDP. There was no way to be competitive in anything, or export anything because there was obviously no economies of scale. It was just a dumb decision that showcased how bad a hand we had been dealt with in both the public and private sector. It was kind of wasted money. Because we did not know anything, we had no patents, no knowledge of anything. We still don't to this day, to be honest. We just import machinery in this country. We do not invent them. It is the only reason we do not have any modern banking infrastructures. Modern open banking where anybody could build applications have to be built. Modern government infrastructure have to be built. You can't import things like that. Until the US finds a reliable way to simplify it greatly alteast. You have to build your own stuff. The thing is, we can build it today. But the people who can, are not the leaders of the country. Leaders of companies. That is why we need change things. The people who can do these things are here and dying to help their country. Their country does not want their help. There are plenty of very competent software engineers in the country. Anyway, we lost a lot of savings in useless import substitution and when you add to that the stealing of resources, you get the collapse of the 1980's.

So then how did the Economic Miracle happen? The devil is in the details. The economic miracle did happen and was a miracle of free trade but most importantly, it was an economic miracle because of what the fate of african countries generally were. It was a miracle bacause we escaped our pre-determined fate of being branded as a banana republic by the international community. Although, the joke is obviously on us given we are a banana republic today. It was a sarcastic jab in some sense. What happened was in the real world by no means extraordinary but when you placed it in context, what happened took place in Africa. That was the miracle, not what anybody did but rather the fact that an African country had finally been able to leave the trenches of Africa. So to who do we owe this success ? To everybody, who worked hard at the time, and that of course includes SAJ and any other politician but also any 'labourer'. But the biggest contributor remains external, free trade. You see, sometimes things align by people just following their self-interests and the magic of free trade happens. When import substitution failed, SSR backpedaled and decided to turn that project into what became export processing zones or ''zone franche'' if you lived in that time. That would have failed too but problems started emerging in international trade in the 1970's. Problems that needed solutions. Some countries were exporting excessively in the advanced economies and so the [Multi Fiber Arrangement](https://en.archive.maquilasolidarity.org/issues/trade/MFA) was made to impose quotas and limit exports from developping countries to developped ones. That was a boon for mauritius, who as a country whose quotas remained unused benefitted tremendously from it. Because it forced a lot of taiwanese and hong kong manufacturers to come here to be able to go above their quotas and continue fulfilling their orders to those developped countries. The local conglomerates copied and learned from them and eventually bought some of their factories. So, we indeed got a miracle. An African miracle because we truly did something that was impossible. We progressed against all odds.

When you look at the table or the log scaled graph you can clearly see, we were really struggling to have consistent growth from the 60's-80's because sugarcane like any crop is dependent on weather conditions. A good year would push GDP up only for it to contract and go down again the next because of bad weather conditions. Textiles, on the other hand were consistent. World population was rising, they needed to be clothed and so we got a free ticket from fulfilling that need that allowed us to get out of the trenches of poverty that plagued Sub Saharian Africa back then and still does to this day. But this is where all our problem ironically start as well. You see, we have not done anything since the 1980's beside import all the capital we can afford. We have imported a lot of capital, transitioned to a services economy which was a bad thing to do given that is what made us converge to zero growth. We decreased our long term productive capacity slowly for short term profits which pushed us to zero growth in 2019. It is good to say this bluntly. Our country, de-industrialised without having ever really been fully industrialised first. Why? Because we do not know shit. You can only do shit you know. Like exploit elsewhere where labor is cheaper for labor intensive manufacturing in India. What about here though? All we excelled at was importing capital. Be a jack of all trades. Good at nothing but present everywhere.

## A world wide increase in living standards


Now why is it then, that no political party has been able to reproduce another economic miracle in the Republic of Mauritius after the one that happened in the 1980's? Why is it that no one knew what the ingredients to that initial success was, so that they could once again cook another miracle? Do you seriously never ask yourself that question? What did we have then that we do not have now? I already told you the answer. The answer is free trade. An ingredient that is out of our control because we did not do anything to make it happen. Globalisation happened, and the domination of free trade changed the world without anybody needing to be more competent. America, Europe and Asia brought their competenece forward and carried the world, by gifting them their labor intensive manufacturing operations by giving them their equipment as capital that they could import as they now moved to the capital intensive electronics age we live in. It is hard to fathom the value chains that free trade coupled network systems (the internet), and computers have made possible. It is crazy, how much living standards has improved because of it. Just like they did in the industrial revolution by increasing living standards by its biggest amount ever to give people worldwide basic plumbling through trade as long as they could afford it.

All of these, are things that you do not need to go invent today. All that is required of you is your co-operation for you to use these ready made things or technologies for most of things you do. You call that importable free technology. Even the materials for basic toilet plumbing is free importable technology. Technology that is freely importable is not longer considered technology however for the rest of the world that imports it. It is just capital. They rarely know anything about it. They will employ people that knows how to use the capital but not how to build it. It must be said that this is a phase every country must go through to sort itself out. Technology really allowed competence to bloom in most advanced economies where free markets existed. Most of the people at any of the fortune 500 companies today has nothing in common with their counter parts that led those companies post world war two. Most did not even exist back then. You must truly understand this current era we live in, is the most competitive the world has ever been. Especially among the top 500 companies in the world but only. Globalisation changes business and even academia. Everything became more competitive, music, comedy, tv, sports. To be at that level means that in your own way you can connect many fields of study. That is your value, you are not the smartest in any room. You can nevertheless enter almost any room and follow the conversations that are going on in them. That is what it takes to be a leader of a fortune 500 company today. To be the swiss army knife.

The Republic of Mauritius imports capital. It has none of that. It is not me being offensive. It is the truth. It cannot have it. We are a country that is not on any frontier of technology and science. We are a freeloader of the world by excellence. That is why there is no freemarket, no vision, nothing here. It is an empty island we all live in with a lot of talk. Empty nevertheless is all the talk. The past 56 years prove it enough. All we do is one thing. We just import capital and use the technology that is handed to us on a platter. Can barely fucking invent anything. In all sectors of the economy. We are collectors of companies but not good at anything in particular. There is so little competition in this country that some conglomerates own banks for some reason. There has never been a single landmark antitrust case or legislation. That is why the majority of our increases in real output comes from that solely. The accumulation of that free technology and the productivity that comes along from using that capital. Look the truth is, if our country had just one firm that did wealth management, that was better than any firm in the world, trillions of dollars would come rushing in the country, leaving New York, Beijing, Tokyo, Paris, and London. That is power of competence. I'm being real with you. The almighty dollar is enamored with competence. Of being able to do something better than others. Money circulates where the competence is because that is where the money can also be more efficiently used to generate more money. 

Do you understand that? The almighty dollar, does not care about consent. Where competence is high, it will go in flocks. But wait? It does come in Mauritius too in the global business sector? Why? What do we have here in Mauritius exactly? Does money come in for the competence in the global business sector? A lot of companies come here because of the possibility of setting up modern sweat shops here for labour intensive cheap backoffice accounting, the human resources administration services, and the sofware development services etc... Mostly though, in the case of global businesses, they come here because of the conveniences it provides them which hugely outweight the costs when it concerns setting companies to route investments to other places in the world. Because of the rule of law that is non existent, so that anybody can launder as much money as they want with properties and some other flimsly tricks via the global business sector. Giving companies the ability to evade taxes. That is not competence, that is a technicality. Technicalities are never permanent. They are loopholes engineered by powerful people wishing to evade taxes. The dollar that comes in flocks to our country only comes in flocks to pass through it to go somewhere else, and to benefit from DTAA's. The biggest flow that is India's is now dwindling as from 2024. So this very thing which has been holding Mauritius for the past ten years along with the sale of real estate to foreigners is bound to be the very thing that will be our undoing if capital flight happens.


## Economic growth in the long run

So the people in control of this country are just as much headless chickens as the ones in the private sector. That is the biggest problem of the Republic of Mauritius. It would do you good to remember this, if competence does not exist, honest opinions cannot exist. Morality cannot exist. I cannot give a fuck about you if giving a fuck about you would mean, I lose my privileged place in society. That is just the blunt truth. I cannot give a fuck about you, if I all can do is kill your children to earn money by engaging in drugs trade. I cannot give my honest opinion if giving my honest opinion of things would mean government would close its tap of public money to me, which would bring me open to the most dreaded of possibilities, bankruptcy. The private sector really does not care as to who comes in power. It only cares about its interest. So it cannot give a single fuck about you. This makes politics pointless in the Republic of Mauritius. Because powerful people in the private sector are simply not equipped to give a fuck. They will all make generous contributions to all parties and do their best to stay in the good books of any government for their own self interests. Because there is zero competition, its all useless. It could only harm them to engage in anyway. They already have everything. A golden spoon given in the way laws are made for them. I am not saying the private sector does not care. Maybe they do but they are not allowed to care. Because they cannot go at it alone. 

I don't really blame the conglomerates. I'm sorry. I just don't. They are not politicians. None of them ever came on camera every week and pretended to give a fuck about you all. I am not even mad at the conglomerates for not potentially caring about the general population because it is basic human nature and nothing to frown upon. That is not their responsibility. I am only mad that dumb people stand at the top of the country. But your wellbeing and my wellbeing is not on them in the end. You should always expect them to be looking to earn the maximum amount they can, even the most competent person. As government, if you want morality to exist, you need to have laws that enable a lot of competition. Who would refuse to be given a monopoly in a market so they can get free money and be fed from a literal golden spoon.^[I would not. You would not. Nobody would.] Allright, that should be enough destruction for this paper. Let's get serious now, and focus on understading economic growth. Modern Economic growth is all Robert Solow and to a lesser degree Trevor Swan who both invented the [Exogenous Growth Model](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Solow1956.pdf) after world war 2. Switch gears, it is going to get mathematical now.


Just like price, in our last paper, output is not easy to estimate because there are so many different markets in a country, and yet, we can simplify things to make it easier to try to understand the behavior of output in the long run in any economy. The output you generally see that is reported in the news every quarter is estimated very laboriously just like price is. Which is why like inflation, output can be easily manipulated by playing with numbers. Mostly just modifying the GDP deflator will do the trick but sometimes you can be cheeky and boost production numbers too. The Republic of Mauritius has done both since 2013. From 2014 to 2019, government boosted production numbers. Since 2020, government has been boosting production numbers, and under reporting the GDP deflator. The methodology used to esimate output every quarter is owed to Wasilly Leontif for his invention of the input-output model. Basically, he suggested using linear algebra to calculate total output of a country. [A friendly introduction to that if you want to learn it can be found here and is easy to digest.](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linear_Algebra/Topic:_Input-Output_Analysis)

The beauty of the exogenous growth model comes from being able to abstract all of this away by using assumptions that simplify the construction of the model. The models assumes that there is only one capital good that is produced, accumulated, and undergoes depreciation. There is perpetual full employment. That greatly simplies things in that we can simply use an aggregate production to construct the model. There is no inflation to consider but if we did consider them prices are perfectly flexible in the long run.

::: {.callout-note}
## The Key Assumption
Real GDP $Y(t)$ is determined by a production function using these two factors we just talked about. The one capital good and a predetermined amount of labor of which all are always employed i.e there is perpetual full employment. $Y=F(K,L)$. One production function which can accomodate these assumptions is the Cobb-Douglas production function where.

\begin{equation}\tag{1}
Y(t)= K^{\alpha}(t)(A(t)L(t))^{1-\alpha}
\end{equation}
:::

Let’s go through each of the pieces of this.

1. $K(t)$ is the total stock of capital in the economy at time $t$. This combines the values of all structures, equipment, and intellectual property used by all the establishments. More capital, more real GDP.

2. $L(t)$ is the total amount of labor in the economy at time $t$. This could be a count of the number of workers, or we can get fancy and think of it as a combined stock of skills and abilities that those workers bring with them. Either way, more labor, more real GDP.

3. $A(t)$ is the level of productivity at time $t$. We’ll have more to say later about what this really measures, but for now keep in mind that is measures how efficiently we use the capital and labor in the economy. Higher productivity, higher real GDP. This is what we simply do not have in Mauritius just FYI.

Let us also look at why the Cobb-Douglas is the most common and popular choice among production functions. It is because it can handily respect the following conditions.

1. The first is CRS (Constant Returns to scale) which just means that a doubling of inputs will double output. Doubling capital and labor in mauritius will automatically double the output we produce. That is what it means.

\begin{equation}\tag{2}
A(cK)^{\alpha}(cL)^{1-\alpha} = (c^{\alpha} c^{1-\alpha})Y = cY
\end{equation}

2. The second is the first and second derivative of output Y with respects to K or the Marginal Product of Capital (MPK). The cobb-douglas production function entails decreasing marginal returns to capital accumulation. This turns out to be the key element of the model. What does this mean in layman terms? If a firm acquires an extra unit of capital, it should raise its output. But if the firm keeps piling on extra capital without raising the number of workers available to use this capital, the increases in output will probably taper off. In the Cobb-Douglas case, the parameter $\alpha$ dictates the pace of this tapering off.

\begin{equation}\tag{3}
Y_{K} > 0 \quad Y_{KK} < 0
\end{equation}

The basics of the solow model are the following equations. 

- Capital accumulates according to

\begin{equation}\tag{4}
\dot{K}(t) = Y(t) - C(t) - \delta K(t) = S(t) - \delta K(t)
\end{equation}

In other words, the addition to the capital stock each period depends positively on
savings (this is a closed-economy model so savings equals investment) and negatively
on depreciation, which is assumed to take place at rate $\delta$. In simple words, more savings equal a higher upper bound for our final capital stock and a higher depreciation will set a lower upper bound ([supremum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum_and_supremum)) for our final capital stock by making the cost of maintenance of capital higher.

- Labour input grows at rate n meaning

\begin{equation}\tag{5}

\frac{dL}{dt}= nL \quad L(t) = L_{0}\exp(nt)
\end{equation}

- Labour Efficiency or Productivity grows at rate g meaning

\begin{equation}\tag{6}

 \frac{dA}{dt}= gA \quad A(t) = A_{0}\exp(gt)

\end{equation}

- A fraction of output is saved each period which is also net investment.

\begin{equation}\tag{7}
 Y(t)-C(t)= sY(t)
\end{equation}

Most elementary analysis of the solow model will be focused on understanding the steadystate. I will cover this so that you may test your understanding of what I have discussed with you so far. Suppose I solved the solow model for the following production function. 

\begin{equation}\tag{8}
 Y(t)=K^{0.5}(t)(AL^{0.5}(t))
 \end{equation}

What do we do know ? How do we proceed ? We could start by acknowledging (7) as the net increase in capital stock for every period or $\dot{K}$. Note that, I will leave out the time notation hereon because of tediousness involved in writing them all the time. So we get

\begin{equation}\tag{9}
 \dot{K} = sY 
\end{equation}

Now we can insert (8) back in (9) to get (10)


\begin{equation}\tag{10}
 \dot{K} = s(K^{0.5},(AL^{0.5})) 
\end{equation}

Now we could divide everything with a factor $c=\frac{1}{AL}$ to give us what ? 

$$ \frac{Y}{AL} = (\frac{K}{AL},1) $$

We could now define $y = \frac{Y}{AL}$ as output per effective worker and $k=\frac{K}{AL}$ as capital per effective worker. We would now thus end with the fundamental differential equation called the law of motion of capital in (11) by inserting (4), (5) and (6) in $\frac{(10)}{c}$ 

\begin{equation}\tag{11}
\dot{k} = sy - (g + n + \delta)k = sk^{0.5} - (g+n+\delta)k
\end{equation}

Graphically or geometrically, we say that the change in $k$ is given by the difference of $sy$ and $(g+n+\delta)k$. As long as $sy > (g+n+\delta)k$ then $k$ will increase. On the other hand as long as $sy < (g+n+\delta)k$, you guessed it $k$ will decrease. When $sy = (g+n+\delta)k$, yes you guessed it right again, that is where a steady state is reached and $\dot{k}=0$ or the change in k is zero. We can thus solve for the steady state capital per effective worker by making 

$$0 = s(k^{*})^{0.5}-(g+n+\delta)k^{*} = k^{*} = (\frac{s}{n+g+\delta})^\frac{1}{1-0.5} $$

Likewise for steady state output per effective worker we find that output per worker grows at rate $n+g$ ie at the rate that $AL$ grows that is population growth and labor productivity. We call that the balanced growth path because this is basically a constant growth rate when $k^{*}$ (the steady state is reached). 

$$ y^{*} = (\frac{s}{n+g+\delta})^{\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}} $$

Now, people like to say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Let's graph what this all means, in practice. Now, I will explain the graphs to you but, if you understood what has been discusses so far you should generally have an inkling of the explanations before I give them to you. Because the solow model is elegant and intuitive. So, if you can guess as the explanations. That's a good sign that you have understood everything so far.

So $k^{*}$ is the steady state which means what ? At that point net investment and net depreciation are equal so the net change in $k$ is zero. On the flipside if we start at the right most side of the graph where $k_0=2$ what will happen ? Net depreciation will be more than net investment which will force $k$ down to $k^{*}$. If we start at the left most side of the graph where we can set the intial value $k_0=0.1$ what will happen ? Net depreciation will be less than net investment which will push $k$ up to $k^{*}$ the steady state. Easy enough ? Differential equations that have steady states are fairly simple to comprehend. Depending on the initial value of $k_0$ that you will choose, the system will either move up to $k^{*}$ or be forced down to $k^{*}$ Let us visualise this with another graph to make sure you get it. The solow model, is all about the steady state. All economies in the world have different states which they are converging to at all times.

def g(A, s, alpha, delta, k):
    return A * s * k**alpha + (1 - delta) * k

A, s, alpha, delta = 2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4
x0 = np.array([.25, 1.25, 3.25])

ts_length = 20
xmin, xmax = 0, ts_length
ymin, ymax = 0, 3.5
def simulate_ts(x0_values, ts_length):

    k_star = (s * A / delta)**(1/(1-alpha))
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=[11, 5])

    ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)

    ts = np.zeros(ts_length)

    # simulate and plot time series
    for x_init in x0_values:
        ts[0] = x_init
        for t in range(1, ts_length):
            ts[t] = g(A, s, alpha, delta, ts[t-1])
        ax.plot(np.arange(ts_length), ts, '-o', ms=4, alpha=0.6,

Now this particular setup is discrete and not continuous, but it is useful if you are not used to the derivative. Do you see how the curve is changing as it is getting closer to the steady state? All the $k_0$ starts as a curve and finishes when it reaches the steady state as a flat line. Why ? You should be able to answer that. If you cannot, find the answer then do not move on because I will go more advanced in the next part. [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SljsIacQDbc) and [this and always remember that youtube is your friend !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQR7rO-I96A). For those that can understand this, let us look at the continuous version of this same process.

```{python}
A, s, alpha, delta = 2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4

def g_con(A, s, alpha, delta, k):
    return A * s * k**alpha - delta * k
def plot_gcon(kstar=None):

    k_grid = np.linspace(0, 2.8, 10000)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=[11, 5])
    ax.plot(k_grid, g_con(A, s, alpha, delta, k_grid), label='$f(k)$')
    ax.plot(k_grid, 0 * k_grid, label="$f'(k)=0$")

    if kstar:
        fps = (kstar,)

        ax.plot(fps, 0, 'go', ms=10, alpha=0.6)


        ax.annotate(r'$k^* = (\frac{s}{ n+g+\delta})^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$',
                 xy=(kstar, 0),
                 xycoords='data',
                 xytext=(0, 60),
                 textcoords='offset points',
                 fontsize=15,
                 arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->"))

    ax.legend(loc='lower left', fontsize=15)

    ax.set_xlabel("$f(k)$",fontsize=15)
    ax.set_ylabel("$f'(k)$", fontsize=15)

    ax.set_xticks((0, 1, 2, 3))
    ax.set_yticks((-0.3, 0, 0.3))

    plt.show()
kstar = ((s * A) / delta)**(1/(1 - alpha))
plot_gcon(kstar)
```

Unlike the previous graph this graph is continuous and shows some salient features of the cobb-douglas production function as we discussed at the start which is diminishing returns. In the solow model the slope of capital at any time is called the Marginal Product of Capital and is abbreviated MPK. Similarly we have the Marginal Prodct of labor and it is abbreviated MPL.

$$ MPK = \frac{\partial{F(K,L)}}{\partial{K}} = \frac{\text{Change in Output}}{\text{Change in Capital}} = r $$
$$ MPl = \frac{\partial{F(K,L)}}{\partial{L}} = \frac{\text{Change in Output}}{\text{Change in Labor Force}} = w $$



Meaning how much does output change from a given change in capital. In the cobb douglas production function, as you can see from the graph when the first unit of capital is added the MPK is infinite because of the vertical asymptote. When the last unit of capital is added the MPK is zero. Mathematically we write them as [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)) conditions.

$$\lim_{k \to 0} f'(k) = \infty $$
$$\lim_{k \to \infty} f'(k) = 0 $$

Now, so far we have left price out but we may now bring price in by going from real to nominal prices in the following fashion.

$$ Y\cdot P = WL + RK $$

Dividing by price we get

$$ Y = (\frac{W}{P})L + (\frac{R}{P})K = wL + rK $$

We can now show that the real wage grows at the rate of technological progress or increases in labor productivity/efficiency $g$. Define and set w equal to

$$ TLI = \text{Total Labor Income} $$
$$ L =\text{Labor Income}$$

Write the equation as a growth series and re-arrange accordingly into the fact that income grows at rate $n+g$ in steady state.

\begin{equation}\tag{12}
w = \frac{TLI}{L} \\
\frac{\dot{w}}{w} + \frac{\dot{L}}{L} = \frac{\dot{TLI}}{TLI} \\
$$ n + g = \frac{\dot{TLI}}{TLI} $
\end{equation}

However it is also true that total income itself grows at rate $n+g$ in steady state giving us the following too

$$ n + g = \frac{\dot{Y}}{Y} $

Do you remember the last paper and the laws you learned ? You might not have noticed yet but economies in general do not really reach their steady states ever because no economy has a marginal product of capital that is zero.
