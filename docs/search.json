Did the words and alphabets of each language exist 500 million years ago? The answer to that is of course a big old NO. We human beings invented the languages we use. One might then ask, well how do we know that a computer ought to be called a computer, or that the sun ought to be called the sun? Why not call it Bob, I would fancy that. Let’s all call the sun Bob from now on. Why do we not do it? You very well could, nobody is stopping you but most people would not understand you because their brain would not map Bob \\(\\longrightarrow\\) Sun.

Your brain will tell you the color you are looking at although there is no rationale for why red maps to what we perceive as red.1\nSo why does this happen? It happens because your brain is trained like a lab rat to learn these mappings through the art of language learning, vocabulary learning, and sentence writing. We have developed languages with words, then with the alphabet to be able to convey meaning to ‘stuff’ that exists subjectively and objectively. We tend to follow those languages to a tee.

Human behavior is filled with all kinds of nonsense that determines said behavior which is why it is quasi-impossible to predict, although it is nevertheless deterministic. Education is therefore a double-edged sword because education and indoctrination are two sides of the same coin. You can provide your people with reliable information about the entire world by sharing all the best available knowledge that mankind has at its disposal through the process called teaching in schools, colleges and universities or you can use it to your advantage to raise a lot of sheep by altering things here and there. In Mauritius, a simple example is the fact that there is a clash of words today among the older population and the younger population. That is because words like Democracy, Fairness and Merit mean different things to both groups. To the older population democracy, fairness and merit are compatible with communalism. With using their votes to secure their childrens’ jobs. That their vote has a price or needs to imperatively correspond to their race or religious bloc is not odd. It is so normal nobody even questions it. For the younger generation who is less conservative because they were able to get access to education, they are more liberal in their stance and abhorr such associations like I do. Plus the younger generation knows the fine print that their parents were not given because politics disrespects them across the board. The younger generation knows that irresponsible spending is inflationary and benefits no one, younger people know nothing free actually exists in this world.

The King can steal as long as he shares some of his loot with us. The King can do anything as long as he does me X and Y favor. That they believed it however, does not mean you have to. Because that they believed it never meant it was true. You can let go of that way of life. You can put that indoctrination behind you and move forward, so we can go to the next level together. People before us could not. They did have the education required to be able to do it. They were not equipped to forego that way of life.

    "section": "What is socialism ?",
    "text": "What is socialism ?\nDid you really need the word socialism to be invented and emerge in the world of human beings to realise that there is an inherent need for fairness in society because free markets although best left to their own devices, do result in a number of desirable and undesirable outcomes? The primary of which among the undesirable ones is inequality and monopolies resulting from profit maximisation, scale and first mover advantages in a market. So, you need government intervention in any fair society. How much is really the question and where populism can sneak in disguised as socialism? Socialism is just capitalism plus the least amount government of intervention required to make society fair. That is the correct and only objective definition of what socialism is. Socialism is always the way to go when you are willing to interpret it in this objective definition. But that is not the definition that is used here in Mauritius.\nBefore we discuss that, let us understand why socialism is not a choice today but rather the gold standard. John Maynard Keynes in his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money changed the way economics is done forever because he elegantly showed a very simple albeit very pertinent point. That markets can stay in disequilibrium for very long periods of time in a downturn because markets stop clearing meaning that there is a tendency for Prices to not readjust very well in an economic downturn to make demand equal supply because of laws, unions or human expectations and conventions that tend to put inertia on the price of labor and goods and services causing them to become sticky. Keynes suggested how government intervention can help by applying “force” to jolt free markets which left to their own devices would take much much longer to clear on their own (Get the right price adjustments to happen so demand equal supply). That force was fiscal stimulus and programs that put a backstop on aggregate demand like unemployment insurance or programs that decreased inequality that provided a consistent flow of fiscal stimulus so as to always keep the economy at a fair equilibrium with programs like food stamps. Add to that free education, anti-trust laws, general competition laws, regulations for food, health & safety and universal healthcare as well as some minor other things I may have missed and you have most modern economies in the world except the US I guess.",

    "section": "The Couyonne Lepep-ism",
    "text": "The Couyonne Lepep-ism\nObjectively the couyonne lepep-ism is not something that is only prevalent in Mauritius. It is a fan favorite among all governments in the world. Just like the UK washes its sins in India by rewriting history in its A-Level curriculum, or the USA washes its sins of the genocide it committed early in its manifest destiny era which was a major inspiration for Germany and its subsequent nazi horrors. Nazi Germany was only following America’s tradition of eugenics and mass massacre, to begin with to make Europe great again. To make another Roman Empire. The thing to keep in mind is that nothing is truly as it is told when it concerns history. Human beings have biases and that will affect how human history is depicted by governments based on their self-interests. A tyrant will be a hero if self-interest calls for such a thing to be the case. The world is a horrible place, but it is that which makes the momentary peace we can secure every now and then that much more enjoyable. If you want to have an objective opinion of the world, you can only have one by understanding the science that rules the world. Science will not lie just as Human Nature will not lie. Why is capitalism so successful? Because capitalism is the only objective description that a society can truly have. Any other is subjective. All societies run on greed which is dominated by gilded ages, and then are followed by small periods of great equality before going back to a rinse and repeat. Man is flawed. There is no good or bad. There is only good and bad. Karl Marx’s ideology of communism is not something that actually exists objectively, it is fluff used by many greedy people throughout history to get control of factors of production and to create a defacto Monarchical system in their countries. We call them dynasties in Mauritius but they exist in a lot of other places across the world. Objectively that is what communism has been if you study it. It has never been what it has claimed to be. This is what the older politicians in our country do not get. Science has you beat.\nYou are not different. You are not that one political party that is not a political machine. Because that is what all political parties are. That is the science. Human beings if nothing else will always excel at being human beings. That is the problem in Mauritius. Acting holier than thou with the younger generation, when all of us know that what is required in Mauritius is not the perfect politician but just for the goddamn laws to work. We know you stole money, all of us know you stole money. We know we are not different and that we could have done it too for all we know if we were in your shoes. That is not what bothers us. What bothers us is that you did not serve that prison time you should have served for all those crimes. What bothers us is the rule of law fumbling time and time and time again and being unable to secure even an ounce of justice, a lot of times on purpose. There are an incalculable amount of people in Mauritius doing obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting every day by not investigating anything that is sent to them and getting close to a million rupees per month for it. Do you think all the young people in this country do not know that? How dumb do you think we are? Now, one will perhaps ask, well is the world communist then? Yes and no. The world is converging on extremes either the left or the right. Whether it be the left or the right the convergence will only be successful when two conditions happen. Number one is that any country converges towards a big government, which just has way too much arbitrary human bias that rules them. A bigger government automatically equals bigger political machines and a bigger amount of savings that is stolen. It can only be inefficient, the bigger it gets because we are all greedy. Number two is that the state converges towards the weakening of the rule of law until it stops working completely. Plenty of countries fulfill those two conditions today or are on the road to fulfilling them. We have been fulfilling it for a lot of years. When that happens, you are done, you can no longer pretend to be a socialist economy. You are a communist or a fascist country. When laws stop working, it’s no longer about being a welfare state, it’s about being a mafia state and just expropriating all the savings of a country in a typical political machine fashion.\nThe biggest problem that Mauritius faces today is the hoarding of its capital. Not all people are allowed to shine in Mauritius. You could be extremely incompetent and still shine due to the fact that you are part of the Monarch of Mauritius, by getting money continuously thrown at you. Public tax money. That is inefficient, because these people did not generate new savings in the end. These people just ate billions of savings of the country and gave nothing in return and is still asking for more and is being given more. We are letting incompetence shine rather than competence. That is how we got here. You see, the capital-output ratio and the capital-labor ratio are low in Mauritius, which means that, the price of capital is consequently high and real wages are low, but take a country like China for example. Even though it is a communist country, it does not matter, because its KY ratio is so high, and the price of capital is cheap, meaning there are relatively low barriers to entry finance-wise. Likewise, any other advanced economy in Europe that has a big government will have the same characteristics. So there is a lot more competition in those countries. We want that to happen in Mauritius. But it has not happened. The one player that was making the market more competitive (BAI) was killed. Facts remain facts. BAI was destroyed because the capital owners of our country did not agree with their way of running things. BAI was pro-competition which the rest of this country is heavily against. Oligopolies is the sweetspot in Mauritius. The illusion of competition. Which is why, they pulled out their capital by working together and conspiring to take the man down. The man did not die though. There was no Ponzi of any kind. He had more capital than they could have imagined, their plan failed pathetically. So, they panicked and revoked the banking licence of this man, with the central bank failing its fiduciary duty to the components of the financial system (basically you the people) of the Republic of Mauritius which is to act as a lender of last resort so that your money stays safe. This is what should have happened, but even then with the central bank pathetically failing its duties, the capital was found but the money was rejected and the banking licence was revoked. In the end, they retorted by bullying him and making him go through hell when their conspiracy failed by lying and doing what they did best - inventing a story about a Ponzi scheme to forcefully crush him.\nThese people are not your friend, you need to realise this. If you were to become that man tomorrow, your fate would not be different if you were not part of this incest club of Mauritius. Screaming democracy! democracy! does not make a country democratic. We need free capital markets which are looking to make the best buck not a bunch of insecure wankers who have to make your life miserable just so they can maintain their lifestyles. We need trillions of dollars of capital to make this country democratic over the next 50 years. We can have it if you start choosing competent people. We have to privatize most state-owned companies to bring huge amounts of foreign capital in. For example, the CEB has to be privatized, ideally giving the buy to a US company that has good relations with a refiner, who hopefully is willing to invest big bucks. We are talking billions here, of dollars yes. The plan has to be to refine and produce lots of stuff here for further processing, export and domestic (port) consumption. We can do other stuff that comes with entering this value chain and work our way up to electronics step by step. Madagascar lacks electricity coverage. We can export electricity to Madagascar and it would be a win-win for both of us. We can build an interconnector to Reunion too to better manage our electricity needs and build one to Rodrigues, where we can build solar farms or even a small modular nuclear reactor (they are climate friendly). We’ll have economies of scale, and cost savings and that will be our point of entry into capital-intensive industrial manufacturing. The biggest factor inputs that we can have control over and compete in are electricity prices, if we can do it cheap enough, and transport subsidies that the government can give. The manufacturing will come if the factor inputs are cheap enough. Population growth is not going to magically come overnight. But those two things, I just mentioned, would be our win condition in the short-medium term. This is me being very serious. This is not a choice we can avoid. We either stay stuck in limbo or you do capital intensive stuff and become a developped economy. We need economies of scale, nothing else will cut it. Our output per worker is not 11 or 12k, it is around 9-10k at best. That is the peak you will get stuck at doing labour intensive industries without generous trade deals. It’s not easy but it is the only path to success that does not require us handing our sovereignty to another country to be its satellite state. We currently are doing that. That is what we are currently. A satellite state. A stooge like Lee Kuan Yew liked to say. Doing all of this will only be profitable for you the people of the Republic of Mauritius in the long run. Your real wages across the board are what will go up in this scenario. These kinds of things will allow us to become an advanced economy and you to have any dream you wish. We need to open the country up completely to foreign capital so there is competition. It is very important for Mauritius to build its relations with the US in other sectors, other than financial services so that we may actually become America’s favorite place to set up ANY business in Africa rather than SA. You do that by building relationships with lots of US businesses. But this is what our country dislikes. Competitors.\nDo you even realise what reliable electricity access would do for Madagascar? People in this country always moan that we must do agriculture, but why should we when there is a country that has a thousand times our arable land? Why should we do agriculture when they could do it and we could do the better thing (the core activity rather than the periphery activity) and just buy agriculture from them with our export earnings of electricity by both being better off with free trade? My vision for Mauritius is not farfetched, we can become the core of Africa. We can have a country where anybody can become president, where anybody can become the richest, where everybody has a bill of rights protecting them, and where we can have the Mauritian dream exist for everyone after 56 long years. This country can become more than just a ‘fake paradise’, it can become the absolute best place to live in the entire world. This country can belong equally to all citizens. We can become the industrialised economy of this part of the world. All of this is very doable and all you need to do is let the truly competent people come in and do what is best for our country.\nPolitics in our country has been pathetic for more than thirty years now. It has always been this silly dance involving theatrics, and a dumb game of inbreeding that is practiced with the complicity of the private sector, which is true of most places to be fair. The US does the same thing, but the US has a private sector that keeps it growth steady. We do not. We have no growth ( We expand only after contractions to get back to the initial point only to contract again and repeat that cycle). We have wasted the last 10 years just doing this. We can go 10 more. Hell we can go 20, 30 more. Unless you wake the fuck up, and let go of the preconcevied notions that you were indoctinated with growing up. Accept that the elites of this country across the board, are holding it back. Can you do that? Accept the taboo truth this country must confront to be able to ever hope to progress even a single step forward. Because until we do that. Everything else is pointless, any discussion is pointless. I am wasting my time, you are wasting your time and anybody that wants a better Mauritius is wasting their time because guess what ? The people in charge want no part in a better Mauritius. They want good old dynasty Mauritius where they get to do whatever the hell they want. It works for them. It has worked for 56 years and it will work for 56 more at your expense. By exploiting you at every downturn for their sweet sweet abuse of owner’s distribution and the personal slush funds they build up over some interval of time which will ultimately put them at risk of good old insolvency ; for not keeping enough capital in their business to cushion a sudden drop in profitablity — completely messing up their cashflows which will turn negative but good news. Your tax money will save them once again as it has for 56 years. As one people, as one nation, in peace justice and liberty, nou verser 56 bananer encore. Ecarter toujour ki to l’ai mo dire toi. Mo alle etirer, mo vini moisi la.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S\n\n\n\nOn another note, inflation expectations have shot up even more given COL adjustments have gone from 1500-2000 for this year to 4925 which is more than 10x the cost of living adjustment of 2020 which is starting to become scary. Its almost 17x. So cause and effect wise, this increased cost of labor will be passed on in the goods and services fully because productivity naiba - increasing the RER which means the potential output (supply side) is going to go down which means the lower bound of the unemployment curve has to increase substantially. But it also means elections have to be this year, because inflation is getting out of control and you cannot raise the key rate, that would be a death sentence, because public finances cannot afford to pay to at higher rates. By mid september the population should be showered with central bank money, and parliament should be dissolved before 9 Oct to go for elections quickly the next month before inflation becomes too big a problem.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate on 7 november\n\n\n\nI was slightly wrong on the strategy that ended up being used. it seems central bank money is being used as a carrot for votes. Milking that sweet sweet misery the government itself has been spreading through inflation to deleverage itself and the private sector. All in one fell swoop. Crazy 9000 IQ moves.",

    "text": "Economic Development\nYou should have already deduced this by now if you read the previous article, but our country has collapsed twice in its history and reached zero growth plenty of times because of an overvalued rupee, like right now for example. The first collapse was in the 1980’s. The second is now. This brings up the obvious question. How the hell did this country ever progress to even come here? The answer is with the beauty of free trade and a lot of luck. Mauritius would have been a lot more developed than it is today had it not been held back by its bad management. You see, back in the day, Europe had a thing for colonies for some reason, and it knew just the way to bolster its relations with newly freed countries. Some free money and some preferential trade agreements to be able to get into the good books of some African countries. Of those, Mauritius belonged to. The Yaounde Convention and The Lome agreement for ACP countries were some of the names of the agreements but that is not the most important part. The most important part is, Mauritius got a preferential trade agreement to sell sugar in the European Common Market which the UK was part of at the time. That allowed it to build a sizeable amount of savings. Unfortunately, we had no real understanding of the world. On the advice of international economists, Mauritius tried to industrialise by increasing tariffs as ‘a way to force’ the local conglomerates to go into manufacturing to do what is called import substitution industrialisation.\nOf course, it was a lost cause, given the domestic demand of the country was a drop of water into the ocean which is world GDP. There was no way to be competitive in anything or export anything because there were obviously no economies of scale. It was just a dumb decision that showcased how bad a hand we had been dealt with in both the public and private sectors. Because we did not know anything, we had no patents. We still don’t to this day, to be honest. We just import machinery in this country. We do not invent them. We are not dumb, but we also kind of are because we do not devote enough to science. It is the only reason we do not have any modern banking infrastructures or a very well developed services sector technologically. Modern open banking infrastructure, which would empower anybody to develop applications for example has to be itself built first. Modern government infrastructure has to be built. You can’t import things like that. Until the US finds a reliable way to simplify it greatly atleast. You have to build your own stuff. The thing is, we can build it today. But the people who can, are not the leaders of the country. Leaders of companies. That is why we need to change things. The people who can do these things are here and dying to help their country. Their country does not want their help though. Their country wants to import foreign workers. There are plenty of very competent software engineers in the country. Anyway, we lost a lot of savings in this import substitution fad when it did not work out.\nSo then how did the Economic Miracle happen? The devil is in the details really. The economic miracle did happen and was a miracle of free trade but most importantly, it was an economic miracle because of what the fate of African countries generally were. It was a miracle because we escaped our pre-determined fate of being branded as a banana republic by the international community. Although, the joke is obviously on us given we are a banana republic today. It was a sarcastic jab in some sense. What happened was in the real world by no means extraordinary but when you placed it in context, what happened took place in Africa. That was the miracle, not what anybody did but rather the fact that an African country had finally been able to leave the trenches of Africa. So to who do we owe this success? To everybody, who worked hard at the time, and that of course includes political leaders but also any ‘labourer’. But the biggest contributor remains external, free trade. You see, sometimes things align by people just following their self-interests and the magic of free trade happens. When import substitution failed, the government backpedaled and decided to turn that project into what became export processing zones or ‘’zone franche’’ if you lived in that time. That would have failed too but problems started emerging in international trade in the 1970s, which saved us. Problems that needed solutions. Some countries were exporting excessively in the advanced economies and so the Multi Fiber Arrangement was made to impose quotas and limit exports from developing countries to developed ones. That was a boon for Mauritius, who as a country whose quotas remained unused benefitted tremendously from it. Because it forced a lot of Taiwanese and Hong Kong manufacturers to come here to be able to go above their quotas and continue fulfilling their orders to those developed countries. The local conglomerates copied and learned from them and eventually bought some of their factories, as time passed. So, we indeed got a miracle. An African miracle because we truly did something that was impossible. We progressed against all odds.\n\n\nShow the code\n%%capture\nimport numpy as np\nimport wbgapi as wb\nimport pandas as pd\nimport opinionated\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom cycler import cycler\nfrom opinionated.core import download_googlefont\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter\n\nplt.style.use(\"opinionated_rc\") \ndownload_googlefont('Atkinson Hyperlegible', add_to_cache=True);\nplt.rc('font', family='Atkinson Hyperlegible')\n\ndef reformat(a,b):\n  if a &gt; 1000 or -1000:\n    val = round(a/1000,1)\n    new_tick = '${:.0f}K'.format(val)\n    \n  return new_tick\n\ndollar = FuncFormatter(reformat)\n\nplt.rc('axes', prop_cycle=(cycler('color', list(['#00308F','#007FFF','#6F00FF','#4C516D'])) *\n                           cycler('linestyle', ['-', '--', ':', '-.'])))\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndf = wb.data.DataFrame('NY.GDP.PCAP.KD',['MUS',\"SSF\",\"SGP\",\"USA\",\"WLD\",\"CHN\",\"IND\",\"KOR\",\"HKG\"],\ntime=range(1960, 2024, 1), labels=True,numericTimeKeys=True)\n\n\ndf.set_index('Country', inplace=True)\n\ndf = df.T\n\n#df.plot(figsize=(8.75,4),fontsize=13)\n#plt.yscale('log')\n#plt.ylim(0,100000)\n#plt.ylabel('Output per worker (Constant 2015 $)',fontsize=13)\n#plt.xlabel('Date',fontsize=20)\n#plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.35,0.5),fontsize=13)\n#plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(dollar)\n#plt.title('The convergence of different countries', x=1.32, fontsize=20,ha='right',fontweight='bold')\npd.concat([df.head(10), df.tail(10)]).map(\"${:,.0f}\".format)\n\n#plt.savefig('../posts/images/convergence.svg',bbox_inches='tight')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nHong Kong SAR, China\nKorea, Rep.\nIndia\nChina\nWorld\nUnited States\nSingapore\nSub-Saharan Africa\nMauritius\n\n\n\n\n1960\n$nan\n$1,028\n$306\n$238\n$3,650\n$18,992\n$3,612\n$1,139\n$1,414\n\n\n1961\n$3,956\n$1,067\n$310\n$175\n$3,744\n$19,109\n$3,777\n$1,124\n$1,726\n\n\n1962\n$4,334\n$1,077\n$312\n$164\n$3,875\n$19,965\n$3,952\n$1,163\n$1,692\n\n\n1963\n$4,847\n$1,142\n$323\n$176\n$3,985\n$20,546\n$4,240\n$1,206\n$1,877\n\n\n1964\n$5,140\n$1,218\n$339\n$204\n$4,160\n$21,438\n$4,004\n$1,235\n$1,706\n\n\n1965\n$5,740\n$1,274\n$323\n$233\n$4,303\n$22,526\n$4,215\n$1,260\n$1,722\n\n\n1966\n$5,791\n$1,392\n$316\n$250\n$4,443\n$23,715\n$4,530\n$1,253\n$1,626\n\n\n1967\n$5,737\n$1,483\n$333\n$230\n$4,516\n$24,045\n$4,985\n$1,212\n$1,665\n\n\n1968\n$5,807\n$1,640\n$337\n$215\n$4,687\n$24,948\n$5,562\n$1,218\n$1,522\n\n\n1969\n$6,364\n$1,836\n$351\n$244\n$4,865\n$25,472\n$6,237\n$1,293\n$1,570\n\n\n2014\n$41,797\n$28,100\n$1,490\n$7,533\n$9,987\n$55,818\n$54,682\n$1,652\n$9,182\n\n\n2015\n$42,432\n$28,737\n$1,590\n$8,016\n$10,178\n$57,040\n$55,646\n$1,654\n$9,508\n\n\n2016\n$43,088\n$29,467\n$1,701\n$8,517\n$10,344\n$57,659\n$56,899\n$1,630\n$9,868\n\n\n2017\n$44,381\n$30,313\n$1,796\n$9,053\n$10,580\n$58,703\n$59,415\n$1,627\n$10,248\n\n\n2018\n$45,280\n$31,059\n$1,891\n$9,619\n$10,808\n$60,127\n$61,216\n$1,629\n$10,652\n\n\n2019\n$44,195\n$31,646\n$1,944\n$10,156\n$10,977\n$61,331\n$61,334\n$1,628\n$10,957\n\n\n2020\n$41,451\n$31,378\n$1,815\n$10,358\n$10,548\n$59,395\n$59,144\n$1,555\n$9,363\n\n\n2021\n$44,531\n$32,771\n$1,975\n$11,223\n$11,112\n$62,741\n$67,639\n$1,580\n$9,679\n\n\n2022\n$43,283\n$33,690\n$2,098\n$11,560\n$11,365\n$63,721\n$67,949\n$1,598\n$10,570\n\n\n2023\n$43,548\n$34,121\n$2,239\n$12,174\n$11,567\n$65,020\n$65,422\n$1,604\n$11,319\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\quad\\]\n\n\n\nWhen you look at the table or the log scaled graph you can clearly see, that we were really struggling to have consistent growth from the 60’s-80’s because sugarcane like any crop is dependent on weather conditions. A good year would push GDP up only for it to contract and go down again the next because of bad weather conditions. Textiles, on the other hand, were consistent. The world’s population was rising, they needed to be clothed and so we got a free ticket from fulfilling that need that allowed us to get out of the trenches of poverty that plagued Sub-Saharian Africa back then and still does to this day. But this is where all our problems ironically start as well. You see, we have not done anything since the 1990s besides import all the capital we can afford. We have imported a lot of capital, and transitioned to a services economy which was a bad thing to do given that is what made us converge to zero growth. We decreased our long-term productive capacity over time for short-term profits which pushed us to zero growth in 2019. It is good to say this bluntly. Our country, de-industrialised without having ever really been fully industrialised first. Why? Because we do not know how to go to the next level. You can only do what you know. All we excelled at was importing capital. Be a jack of all trades. Excel at nothing on world markets. We are collectors of nontradable companies and real estate. It is not enough. We are going into a wall.",

    "text": "A world wide increase in living standards\nNow why is it then, that no political party or even the private sector, has been able to reproduce another economic miracle in the Republic of Mauritius after the one that happened in the 1980’s? Why is it that no one knew what the ingredients to that initial success were so that they could once again cook another miracle? What did we have then that we do not have now? I already told you the answer. The answer is free trade. An ingredient that is out of our control because we did not do anything to make it happen. Globalisation happened, and the domination of free trade changed the world without anybody needing to be more competent. America, Europe and Asia brought their competence forward and carried the world, by gifting them their labor-intensive manufacturing operations by giving them their equipment, as capital that they could import as they now moved to the capital-intensive electronics age we live in. It is hard to fathom the value chains that free trade coupled with network systems (the internet), and computers have made possible. It is crazy, how much living standards have improved because of it. Just like they did in the industrial revolution by increasing living standards by its biggest amount ever to give people worldwide basic plumbing through trade as long as they could afford it.\nAll of these, are things that you do not need to go invent today. All that is required of you is your cooperation for you to use these ready-made things or technologies for most of the things you do. You call that importable free technology. Even the materials for basic toilet plumbing are free importable technology. Technology that is freely importable is no longer considered technology however for the rest of the world that imports it. It is just capital. We rarely know anything about it. We will employ people who know how to use the capital but rarely will we know how to build it from scratch. The Republic of Mauritius imports capital. We lack the human capital needed to go to the next level, and nobody wants to say it because this is something which could only hurt their bottom line. It is not me being offensive. It is the truth. It cannot have the human capital. We are a country that is not on any frontier of technology and science. We are a freeloader of the world by excellence. We do not do any serious research on anything. We have zero patents after 56 years. That is why there is no free market, no vision, nothing here. It is an empty island, we all live in with a lot of talk of being a paradise. Empty nevertheless is all the talk. The past 56 years prove it enough. All we do is one thing. We just import capital and use the technology that is handed to us on a platter. Can barely fucking invent anything. In all sectors of the economy. We are collectors of companies but not good at anything in particular except perhaps giving our government a good wank to keep the flow of public money steady. There is so little competition in this country that some conglomerates own banks for some reason. There has never been a single landmark antitrust case or legislation. That is why the majority of our increases in real output come from that solely. The accumulation of that free technology and the productivity that comes along from using that capital. Look, the truth is, if our country had just one firm that did wealth management, that was better than any firm in the world, trillions of dollars would come rushing into the country, leaving New York, Beijing, Tokyo, Paris, and London. That is the power of competence. I’m being real with you. The almighty dollar is enamored with competence. Of being able to do something better than others. Money circulates to where the competence can be found in abundance because that is where the money can also be more efficiently used to generate more money.\nDo you understand that? The almighty dollar does not care about consent. Where competence is high, it will go in flocks. But wait? It does come in Mauritius too in the global business sector? Why? What do we have here in Mauritius exactly? Does money come in for the competence in the global business sector? A lot of companies come here, because of the possibility of setting up modern sweat-shops here for labour intensive, back office accounting, human resources administration services and software development services etc… Our country kind of sucks at giving out fair wages. Foreign companies love it, because they get to keep their bills smaller. Mostly though, in the case of global businesses, they come here because of the conveniences it provides them which hugely outweighs the costs, when it concerns setting companies to route investments to other places in the world. The ability to minimize taxes legally with DTAA’s. Technicalities are never permanent though. They are loopholes engineered by powerful people wishing to minimize their taxes. The dollar that comes in flocks to our country only comes in flocks to pass through it to go somewhere else, and to benefit from DTAA’s. The biggest flow that is to India’s capital market is now dwindling as of 2024. Plus with this new CCR levy, one wonders, what is the point exactly anymore? What is our edge? This very thing which has been holding Mauritius together for the past ten years along with the sale of real estate to foreigners is bound to be the very thing that will be our undoing if capital flight happens when companies migrate elsewhere and start claiming their liabilities back.",

    "text": "Economic growth in the long run\nSo the people in control of this country are just as much headless chickens as the ones in the private sector. No one wants to admit but we are completely stuck with no future as a country right now. That is the biggest problem of the Republic of Mauritius. It would do you good to remember this, if competence does not exist, honest opinions cannot exist. Morality cannot exist. I cannot give a damn about you if giving a damn about you would mean, I lose my privileged place in society. That is just the blunt truth. I cannot give my honest opinion if giving my honest opinion of things would mean the government would close its tap of public money to me, which would open me to the most dreaded of possibilities, bankruptcy. The private sector does not really care about who comes into power. It only cares about its interest. So it cannot give a single fuck about you. This makes politics pointless in the Republic of Mauritius. Because powerful people in the private sector are simply not equipped to give a damn. They will all make generous contributions to all parties and do their best to stay in the good books of any government for their own self interests. Because there is zero competition, in the end, it’s all useless. It could only harm them to engage in any way. They already have everything. A golden spoon, in the way laws are made for them. I am not saying the private sector does not care. Maybe they do but they are not allowed to show they care unless they can go at it alone. Some are, although I will not name anybody.\nNow I don’t really blame the conglomerates, to be honest. They are not politicians. None of them ever came on camera every week and pretended to give a damn about you all. That is not their responsibility. Your well-being and my well-being are not on them in the end. You should always expect them to be looking to earn the maximum amount they can, even the most competent person out there. As a government, if you want morality to exist, you need to have laws that enable a lot of competition. Who would refuse to be given a monopoly in a market so they can get free money and be fed from a literal golden spoon.1 I guess this just goes to show that the good old actions speak louder than words is a universal law of nature that is applicable everywhere. Take the minimum wage itself as an example, the biggest accomplishment of the current government. Since it came into force, just go look how much the rupee depreciated. That just shows you not much was gained in the end. You got a breadcrumb. But the less educated cannot add that up. Government exploits that pitiful fact. Facts are facts, even sad facts. Alright, this should be a good enough amount of destruction, of the made-up narratives that were cooked up by politicians as to what this country went through for 56 years. I told you the objective truth. Whether you believe it or not, is up to you and not up to me. Let’s get serious now, and focus on understanding economic growth. Modern Economic growth is all Robert Solow and to a lesser degree Trevor Swan who both invented the Exogenous Growth Model after world war 2. Switch gears, it is going to get mathematical now.\nJust like price, in our last paper, output is not easy to estimate because there are so many different markets in a country, and yet, we can simplify things to make it easier to try to understand the behavior of output in the long run in any economy. The output you generally see that is reported in the news every quarter is estimated very laboriously just like price is. This is why like inflation, output can be easily manipulated by playing with numbers. Mostly just modifying the GDP deflator will do the trick but sometimes you can be cheeky and boost production numbers too. The Republic of Mauritius has done both since 2014. From 2014 to 2019, government boosted production numbers. Since 2020, government has been boosting production numbers, and underreporting the GDP deflator. The methodology used to estimate output every quarter is owed to Wassily Leontief for his invention of the input-output model. Leontief was Solow’s doctoral advisor. Basically, he suggested using linear algebra as a way to calculate the total output of a country. A friendly introduction to that if you want to learn it can be found here and is easy to digest.\nThe beauty of the exogenous growth model comes from being able to abstract all of this away by using assumptions that simplify the construction of the model. The model assumes that there is only one capital good that is produced, accumulated, and undergoes depreciation. There is perpetual full employment. That greatly simplifies things in that we can simply use an aggregate production to construct the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Assumption\n\n\n\nReal GDP \\(Y(t)\\) is determined by a production function using these two factors we just talked about. The one capital good and a predetermined amount of labor of which all are always employed i.e there is perpetual full employment. \\(Y=F(K,L)\\). One production function which can accomodate these assumptions is the Cobb-Douglas production function where.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\nY(t)= K^{\\alpha}(t)(A(t)L(t))^{1-\\alpha}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nLet’s go through each of the pieces of this.\n\n\\(K(t)\\) is the total stock of capital in the economy at time \\(t\\). This combines the values of all structures, equipment, and intellectual property used by all the establishments. More capital, more real GDP.\n\\(L(t)\\) is the total amount of labor in the economy at time \\(t\\). This could be a count of the number of workers, or we can get fancy and think of it as a combined stock of skills and abilities that those workers bring with them. Either way, more labor, more real GDP.\n\\(A(t)\\) is the level of productivity at time \\(t\\). It measures how efficiently we use the capital and labor in the economy. Higher productivity, higher real GDP. This is what we simply do not have in Mauritius.\n\nLet us also look at why the Cobb-Douglas is the most common and popular choice among production functions. It is because it can handily respect the following important conditions.\n\nThe first is CRS (Constant Returns to scale) which just means that a doubling of inputs will double output. Doubling capital and labor in mauritius will automatically double the output we produce. That is what it means.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{2}\nA(cK)^{\\alpha}(cL)^{1-\\alpha} = (c^{\\alpha} c^{1-\\alpha})Y = cY\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nThe second is the first and second derivative of output Y with respects to K or the Marginal Product of Capital (MPK). The cobb-douglas production function entails decreasing marginal returns to capital accumulation. This turns out to be the key element of the model. What does this mean in layman terms? If a firm acquires an extra unit of capital, it should raise its output. But if the firm keeps piling on extra capital without raising the number of workers available to use this capital, the increases in output will probably taper off. In the Cobb-Douglas case, the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) dictates the pace of this tapering off.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{3}\nY_{K} &gt; 0 \\quad Y_{KK} &lt; 0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe basics of the solow model are the following equations.\n\nCapital accumulates according to\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{4}\n\\dot{K}(t) = Y(t) - C(t) - \\delta K(t) \\\\\n= S(t) - \\delta K(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn other words, the addition to the capital stock each period depends positively on savings (this is a closed-economy model so savings equals investment) and negatively on depreciation, which is assumed to take place at rate \\(\\delta\\). In simple words, more savings equal a higher upper bound for our final capital stock and a higher depreciation will set a lower upper bound for our final capital stock by making the cost of maintenance of capital higher.\n\nLabour input grows at rate n meaning\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{5}\n\n\\dot{L} = nL \\quad L(t) = L_{0}\\exp(nt)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nLabour Efficiency or Productivity grows at rate g meaning\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{6}\n\n\\dot{A} = gA \\quad A(t) = A_{0}\\exp(gt)\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nA fraction of output is saved each period which is also total investment.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{7}\nY(t)-C(t)= sY(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nMost elementary analysis of the solow model will be focused on understanding the steady state. I will cover this so that you may test your understanding of what I have discussed with you so far. Suppose I solved the solow model for the following production function.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{8}\nY(t)=K^{0.5}(t)(AL^{0.5}(t))\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhat do we do know ? How do we proceed ? We could start by acknowledging (7) as the net increase in capital stock for every period or \\(\\dot{K}\\). Note that, I will leave out the time notation hereon because of tediousness involved in writing them all the time. So we get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{9}\n\\dot{K} = sY\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow we can insert (8) back in (9) to get (10)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{10}\n\\dot{K} = s(K^{0.5},(AL^{0.5}))\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow we could divide (8) with a factor \\(c=\\frac{1}{AL}\\) to get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{11}\n\\frac{Y}{AL} = F(\\frac{K}{AL},1)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe could now define \\(y = \\frac{Y}{AL}\\) as output per effective worker and \\(k=\\frac{K}{AL}\\) as capital per effective worker giving us \\(y=f(k,1)\\). We would thus end up with the fundamental differential equation called the law of motion of capital by inserting (4), (5), (6), and (11) in (10) giving us\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{12}\n\\dot{k} = sy - (g + n + \\delta)k \\\\\n= sf(k)^{0.5} - (g+n+\\delta)k\n\\end{equation}\\]\nGraphically or geometrically, we say that the change in \\(k\\) is given by the difference of \\(sy\\) and \\((g+n+\\delta)k\\). As long as \\(sy &gt; (g+n+\\delta)k\\) then \\(k\\) will increase. On the other hand as long as \\(sy &lt; (g+n+\\delta)k\\), \\(k\\) will decrease. When \\(sy = (g+n+\\delta)k\\), that is where a steady state is reached and \\(\\dot{k}=0\\) or the change in k is zero. In fact, by integrating (12) and saving on notation we get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{13}\nk(t) = [k_{0}^b +(\\frac{s}{d})\\exp(-bdt)-(\\frac{s}{d})]^{\\frac{1}{b}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(b=1-\\alpha\\) and \\(d=g+n+\\delta\\) and \\(k_{0}\\) is the initial capital stock we start with. It can be seen that as \\(t\\) gets larger and larger, \\(k(t)\\) grows according to \\((\\frac{s}{d})^{\\frac{1}{b}}\\). This can be verified by setting \\(\\dot{k}=0\\) in (12). Which gives us the steady state \\(k^{*}\\).\n\\[0 = s(k^{*})^{0.5}-(g+n+\\delta)k^{*} = k^{*} = (\\frac{s}{n+g+\\delta})^\\frac{1}{1-0.5} \\]\nLikewise in steady state output grows at rate \\(n+g\\) i.e at the rate that \\(AL\\) grows that is population growth and labor productivity while output per worker grows at rate \\(g\\). We call that the balanced growth path because this is basically a constant growth rate when \\(k^{*}\\) (the steady state is reached).\n\\[ y^{*} = (\\frac{s}{n+g+\\delta})^{\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}} \\]\nYou can derive it fairly easily by defining some notation for the economical handling of a growth series by using logs. Using the definition below and using the two following properties of logarithms.\n\\[\\frac{d(\\log Y)}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\log Y)}{dY}\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{Y}}{Y} = G^{Y}\\]\n\\[\\log(X \\cdot Y)= \\log X + \\log Y \\] \\[\\log(X^{Y}) = Y\\log X \\]\nWe modify (8) to get\n\\[ G^{Y} = G^{A} + \\alpha G^{K} + (1-\\alpha) G^{L} \\]\nSetting \\(G^{A}=g\\) and \\(G^{L}=n\\) and \\(\\alpha=0.5\\) we then get\n\\[ G^{Y} = g + 0.5 G^{K} + 0.05 n \\]\nThis means all variations in the growth rate of output are due to variations in the growth rate for capital. If output is growing at a constant rate, then capital must also be growing at a constant rate. And we know that the capital-output ratio tends to move towards a specific equilibrium value. So along a steady growth path, the growth rate of output equals the growth rate of capital. Thus, the previous equation can be re-written as\n\\[ G^{Y} = g + 0.5 G^{Y} + 0.05 + n \\]\nSubstracting \\(0.5 G^{Y}\\) from both sides we get the growth rate of output\n\\[ G^{Y} = \\frac{g}{0.5} + n \\]\nSubstracting \\(n\\) from both sides we get the rate of growth of output per worker\n\\[ G^{Y} - n = \\frac{g}{0.5} \\]\nSo output per effective worker depends negatively on population growth, and capital’s share of total income. It depends positively on \\(g\\) called labor productivity. Now, we will come back to the implications of this a bit further down. For now, lets refocus on the steady state. People like to say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Let’s graph what this all means, in practice. Now, I will explain the graphs to you but, if you understood what has been discussed so far, you should generally have an inkling of the explanations before I give them to you. Because the solow model is elegant and intuitive. So, if you can guess as the explanations. That’s a good sign that you have understood everything so far.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ng, n, s, alpha, delta = 0.02 , 0.02, 1, 0.5, 0.03\nx0 = 0.25\nxmin, xmax = 0, 2\n\ndef graph(g, n, s, alpha, delta, k):\n    return  s * k**alpha - (n+g+delta) * k\n\ndef plot45():\n    xgrid = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 12000)\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n    ax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax)\n\n    graph_values = graph(g, n, s, alpha, delta, xgrid)\n\n    ymin, ymax = np.min(graph_values), np.max(graph_values)\n    ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)\n\n    lb = r'$\\dot{k}_{t} = sk^{\\alpha} - (n+g+\\delta)k$'\n    ax.plot(xgrid, graph_values,  lw=2, alpha=0.6, label=lb)\n    ax.plot(xgrid, xgrid, 'k-', lw=1, alpha=0.7, label='$45^{\\circ}$')\n\n    ax.legend(loc='upper left', frameon=False, fontsize=12)\n\n    circle_rad = 30\n    ax.set_xticks((0, 1, 2))\n    ax.set_yticks((0, 1, 2))\n    ax.annotate(r'$\\dot{k}^{*}_{t} = (\\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta })^{(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha})}$',\n     xy=(0.873, 0.873), xytext=(0.3, 1), arrowprops=dict(\n                arrowstyle='simple,tail_width=0.3,head_width=0.8,head_length=0.8',\n                facecolor='b', shrinkB=circle_rad * 1.2),fontsize=15)\n    ax.set_xlabel('$k_t$', fontsize=12)\n    ax.set_ylabel('$k_{t+1}$', fontsize=12)\n\n    plt.show()\n\n\nplot45()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo \\(k^{*}\\) is the steady state which means what ? At that point total investment and total depreciation are equal so the net change in \\(k\\) is zero. On the flipside if we start at the right most side of the graph where \\(k_0=2\\) what will happen ? Total depreciation will be more than total investment which will force \\(k\\) down to \\(k^{*}\\). If we start at the left most side of the graph where we can set the intial value \\(k_0=0.1\\) what will happen ? Total depreciation will be less than total investment which will push \\(k\\) up to \\(k^{*}\\) the steady state. Easy enough ? Differential equations that have steady states are fairly simple to comprehend. Depending on the initial value of \\(k_0\\) that you will choose, the system will either move up to \\(k^{*}\\) or be forced down to \\(k^{*}\\). Let us visualise this with another graph to make sure you get it. The solow model, is all about the steady state. All economies in the world have different ‘steady states’ which they are converging to at all times.\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.rc('axes', prop_cycle=(cycler('color', list(['#00308F','#007FFF','#6F00FF','#4C516D'])) +\n                           cycler('linestyle', ['-', '--', ':', '-.'])))\n\n# Yes this is a different production function but the graph is what matters here, I did it correctly  for the first graph and it is a pain to get right.

Do you see how the curve is changing as it is getting closer to the steady state? All the \\(k_0\\) starts as a curve and finishes when it reaches the steady state as a flat line. Why ? You should be able to answer that. If you cannot find the answer, then do not move on just yet. Do what I suggest next and ensure you understand before moving on. Watch this and this and always remember that youtube is your friend ! For those that can understand this, let us look at the continuous version of this same process.\n\n\nShow the code\nA, s, alpha, delta = 2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4\n\n# Yes this is a different production function but the graph is what matters here, I did it correctly for the first graph and it is a pain to get right.

In the solow model the slope of capital at any time is called the Marginal Product of Capital and is abbreviated MPK \\(\\frac{\\partial{F(K,L)}}{\\partial{K}}\\). Similarly we have the Marginal Product of Labor and it is abbreviated MPL \\(\\frac{\\partial{F(K,L)}}{\\partial{L}}\\).\n\\[ MPK = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Capital}}\\] \\[ MPL = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Labor}} \\]\nMeaning how much does output change from a given change in capital. In the cobb douglas production function, as you can see from the graph when the first unit of capital is added the MPK is infinite because of the vertical asymptote. When the last unit of capital is added the MPK is zero. Mathematically we write them as limit conditions.\n\\[\\lim_{k \\to 0} f'(k) = \\infty \\] \\[\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f'(k) = 0 \\]\nTo make things even simpler to understand, let us apply it to an example. If we use our example production (8). We can find its MPK and MPL.\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial{F(K,L)}}{\\partial{K}} = 0.5K^{0.5-1}L^{1-0.5} \\]\nWe can re-arrange this by removing the factor \\(K^{-1}\\) out giving us the MPK in a cobb-douglas production function as \\(0.5YK^{-1}\\) or \\(0.5\\frac{Y}{K}\\). The same process can be done for the MPL. Just remember that you only differentiate partially here and leave the rest fixed. We did not touch L. Do the MPL on your own as an exercise using the power rule. Then let us show, how capital accumulation which is what we did here in Mauritius for 56 years can only provide you with growth that fades with time as the MPK goes down. Let us do a simple tabular example. You should do the middle ones on your own. But as you can see in the end this is where we are in our country. Capital does not really do much of anything anymore. We already have a lot of it.\n\n\nThe MPK in any economy given enough time will decrease.\n\n\nTime\nTotal Output\nTotal K\nMPK\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n100\n500\n\\(\\frac{dY}{dK}=0.05\\frac{100}{500}=0.1\\)\n\n\n5\n175\n1000\n\\(0.5\\frac{175}{1000}=0.0875\\)\n\n\n8\n325\n1500\n\\(0.5\\frac{325}{1500}=0.108\\)\n\n\n15\n500\n2000\n-\n\n\n20\n550\n2500\n-\n\n\n35\n635\n4500\n\\(0.5\\frac{635}{4500}=0.0705\\)\n\n\n38\n645\n5000\n\\(0.5\\frac{645}{5000}=0.0645\\)\n\n\n40\n650\n5500\n\\(0.5\\frac{650}{5500}=0.06\\)\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have left price out but we may now bring price in now by going from real to nominal prices and understanding how the MPK (Real Return on Capital) and the MPL (Real Wages) relates to them in the following fashion.\n\\[ Y\\cdot P = WL + RK \\]\nWhere P is prices, W is nominal wages, and R is the Real Return on Capital. Dividing them by \\(P\\) we get\n\\[ Y = (\\frac{W}{P})L + (\\frac{R}{P})K = (MPL)L + (MPK)K = wL + rK \\]\nWe can now show that the real wage grows at the rate of technological progress or increases in labor productivity/efficiency \\(g\\). Define and set w equal to total labor income divided by labor income and transform the equation into a growth series and then re-arrange accordingly into the fact that labor income grows at rate \\(g\\) in steady state.\n\\[ TLI = \\text{Total Labor Income} \\] \\[ L =\\text{Labor Income}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nw = \\frac{TLI}{L}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[ G^{w} = \\frac{G^{TLI}}{G^{L}} \\]\n\\[g = \\frac{G^{TLI}}{n}\\]\nQuite literally if we hold n to be a constant and set \\(n=1\\), then all growth in total labor income comes solely from \\(g\\). Equivalently, if we hold the growth rate of \\(n\\) to be big enough, g becomes smaller and smaller so it may be equally shared among the labor force \\(L\\) earning \\(TLI\\). What do you think has been happening in Mauritius if we take inflation to be around 90% for the period 2020 to 2024. Real wages has been decreasing, and total capital income would have been increasing a lot. So \\(G^{w}&lt;G^{TLI}\\) has been holding for the past four years decreasing the workers share of output every year. Labor’s share of income has been decreasing every year in Mauritius for now four years. If real wages grow faster than total labor income \\(G^{w}&gt;G^{TLI}\\), the share of wages in income goes up and the share of profits in income falls. That is how labor can increase their real share of national income over time.\nIn the United States at one point that made \\(TLI^{US}=\\frac{2}{3}Y\\). It has since gone down, because real wages have not kept up with total labor income increases in the last 30 years, which has brought TLI to \\(TLI^{US}=[0.60,0.66]Y\\). Locally in Mauritius, the same has been true for the last 56 years. \\(TKI^{MU}=[0.52,0.55]Y\\), Total Capital Income has been steady at around 52-55%. Equality? There has been never been much of that, gini indexes are fairly useless. Median real income is what matters and it has been steady. How do I know? Because the share of income has stayed the same. Worse it has decreased in the past four years. Inequality has been more or less the same for most of the last 56 years and in the last four years it has increased dramatically although to say how much is impossible without reliable data. So, that is where, all the record profits being recorded by almost all big companies, come from (They are not real, they are nominal illusions).\nAdditionally, we can already see what effect the import of foreign labor who will do non skilled work will have on your real wages ? It will decrease them, force them down, literally by forcing you to share the total labor income with them that is already much smaller. At best \\(TLI=0.4Y\\) is currently in Mauritius. I have nothing against these people, but that total labor income is already much smaller because of the 90% inflation. Importing foreign labour into our country now would signal the permanent social death of a large of our working population. We can do the same thing for capital by defining the real rate of return on capital to be equal the MPK. Note that there is no need for growth rates here because we are interested in \\(r_{t}\\) alone. We already covered how the MPK works. Go back and review it if you need to.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{14}\nr_{t}  = \\alpha \\frac{Y}{K}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe real return on capital in Mauritius is low. We have already accumulated a lot of capital in the last 30 years. Infact, we might argue that the MPK should have a short term iteration to it, to be able to explain why capital does not come into our country lately. I can attest to it, you can attest to it, the whole country can attest to it. There is a huge FCY shortage. Capital from this country own’s conglomerates stopped flowing into it. They are flowing into US treasuries which is the wise choice if they know of this country’s true position. Of course they do. So, when you factor in real interest rates which should be a solid alternative to the MPK to explain this behavior, it becomes obvious that the elites know how high inflation truly is because of their decisions. It seems obvious to say this but investing in Mauritius is not a very rationally sound thing to do lately. Because the country has been deleveraging hard and this has made real interest rates wildly negative, which is why this country’s elite has most likely already and completely jumped ship into dollars. It is only you and me, the paupers of this land. The slaves, that must be forced to keep our useless currency. So, the real interest rate is calculated as expected inflation minus actual inflation. In the last four years, it has been hugely negative to deleverage our country with inflation.\n\\[ \\pi^{R}_{t} = \\pi^{E}_{t} - \\pi^{A}_{t} \\]\nNow, you might ask, what is expected inflation? What is a good definition of it? It is what people expect inflation to be this year, and so will make their best effort by their actions, to hedge against it. The expected inflation is what they will try to offset when negotiating cost of living adjustments every year. In mauritius we call that “Compensation Salariale”. You can see that it has increased in Mauritius from 2020 to 2024 meaning it indicates a consistent increase in expected inflation \\(\\pi^{E}_{t}\\) from 2020 to 2024.\n\n\nTHIS TABLE ALONE SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU THAT INFLATION IS ONLY GOING UP UP UP.\n\n\nYear\nCost of Living Adjustment\n\n\n\n\n2020\n300 Rupees\n\n\n2021\n375 Rupees\n\n\n2022\n500 Rupees\n\n\n2023\n1000 Rupees\n\n\n2024\n1500-2000 Rupees\n\n\n\n\nThis table should inform you that everybody is expecting inflation to be higher with each passing year and that \\(\\pi^{E}_{2024}\\) is higher than last year. This is why the conglomerates have been short on the rupee by holding their dollars, which is a much smarter choice. It is just a good decision to get out of the rupee because it is a currency that has had 90% inflation in the past four years. So conglomerates have been making record profits only nominally given our country is collapsing. Think about it, has the Government of Mauritius ever restricted the buying and selling of foreign currency like this ever before? They used all kinds of excuses like covid, war, and no tourism. There is more than a dictatorship in the management of foreign currency in Mauritius. Still, you seriously think, they did not get out of the rupee? It is free money for them given they depreciate the currency when they want to because they have total control of the central bank. What is happening with the management of the national currency of this country is downright criminal these days.\nNow let’s move on from the steady state, you see in practice countries rarely finish capital accumulation. Watch this if this seems odd to you. If they finish it they are in trouble, like our country is in because almost always in practice if you finish it you jump to the right side of the steady state where you are not forming enough capital to replace all the depreciated ones. You see this in plenty of countries today. In Mauritius, you can see it everywhere. Delo 24/7 is still a pipe dream (see what I did there :D). Public hospitals are close to complete ruin. Most government buildings are ruined. Safe city cameras will never be replaced, because it costs way too much to replace. Electronic capital stock depreciates quickly and requires that you are quite a rich country to be able to maintain it. We are not. We are poor. So today, we have to make ridiculous choices. Choose which capital stock to replace. Choose which projects are more important to be able to win an election. Build some cheap houses that will almost certainly depreciate as quickly as the new Supreme Court building. Know why? Because we POOR buddy. P O O R. We can either build one hundred good houses that will last one hundred years, or build a thousand that will last five years. Guess which choice we went with? You do not have believe me. Just look at exhibit A : Air Mauritius.\nThe reason why countries do not finish accumulating capital stems from the fact that in steady state output continues to grow at a constant rate \\(n+g\\) called a balanced growth path. This means new real savings in (7) or (9) are always “minted” so more capital may be accumulated with time. In essence, as we discussed in Macroeconomic Laws 1, in monetary terms this is the SI unit of productivity. In a macroeconomic system, there is no other way to look at it, strictly or rigorously. We have real consumption and real savings. Any increase in real output is met with SI unit inflation and productivity through consumption and savings. As more and more productivity is had (more real savings are created), that has the effect of pushing prices down or inflation down because we are differing consumption to a later date. We are not cheating anything. It is a simple system where inflation is guided by the amount of real savings it has at its disposal and the rate at which the system is burning through that real savings with nominal consumption. When these real savings are burned at a faster rate than they get created because of nominal increases of money in the goods and services market (consumption), inflation responds in kind by increasing more and more, and the real savings are burned through quicker.\nFor example most rapid increases in prices from heavy industrialisation in the tradables sector2, comes from exchange rate movements and in the form of non-tradables having to match wage increases, moving the RER. Not inflation, but productivity coming from freshly created real savings which is divided partly between exchange rate \\(k\\) adjustment and real wage \\(w\\) adjustment. Human inaction will cause more exchange rate adjustments. Human action to burn the real savings by increasing \\(w\\) will make less of it fall on the exchange rate. Fixed exchange rates will cause real wages \\(w\\) to bear the brunt of the adjustment. All of these determine the RER which is impossible to measure accurately because it relies on price indexes as discussed in Macroeconmic Laws 1.\nIn that sense, Paul Krugman in his wonderful essay of The Myth of the Asian Miracle is somewhat wrong although he is paradoxally at the same time also right. He gives a lot of importance to efficiency growth or what we call productivity but chooses to look at it as something external to the system basically as a literal \\(A\\) that exists. As if, more real savings (more investment) is not automatically the result of the labor productivity increasing. But rather that labor productivity is something different. That productivity in and of itself exists to an economic system as the literal \\(A\\) . It certainly does when considering the production function which is the equivalent of a closed economy with consumption and savings. Of course, it is a mere detail, and many at the time, the best of the best thought like Krugman, like for example Alywn Young3. Plenty in fact, had different takes on this at the time.4 On why East Asia and the Pacific had been able to converge to join the rich countries club which they are still a part of today. Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, even China has come a long way.\nThis is why, we must understand this phenomenon that the solow model predicts which is called conditional convergence. We must also explain why it failed, for example, why did it fail in Mauritius. The best paper on the matter by Mankiw, Romer and Weil yielded what is called the augmented solow model that adds human capital to it. That paper’s argumentation is ruined by a case like ours. Education has been fine in Mauritius, not extraordinary, not Singapore-like, standard-wise, but it has been decent. Yet, look where we are with our country. That is because the human capital that we possess is not used efficiently at all. The people in control of this country are holding us back. They are not as competent as they pretend to be given they failed in Industrialising our country when they had the complete reigns of it for 56 years now. There are also a lot of oil countries out there, that would not necessarily respect this augmented narrative. They nevertheless respect something much more simple. The generation of consistently more and more savings each period, to be able to have more and more capital formation over a long period of time. If we wish to explain why we failed to converge or why any country fails to converge thus, we must have the honesty to flat-out say it. Its corruption plus incompetence.\nMeaning, that the reason why countries do not converge is that they allocate their resources so inefficiently, that eventually they stop creating new savings, and must then tap into already existing savings. Corruption plus incompetence is a global phenomenon. Thus, depending on just how much fresh savings you are able to generate, it might be less and less obvious. America is just as corrupt as Africa and so is Norway, Sweden, New Zealand, and Singapore. Indeed, rather than get into a debate about corruption plus incompetence, let’s just be blunt and say it, it is all about the capital-output ratio and your output per worker level. The lower it is the bigger the problem of corruption plus incompetence will be, because the shocks you get on savings then are truly detrimental to the development of an economy over time. As you get to a higher and higher capital-output ratio, however, there just comes a point where corruption plus incompetence is inconsequential for the economy. There is just too much savings being generated by the existing capital stock combined with labor productivity. Output per worker has become too big to fail. Your greed and stupidity by then is simply outmatched by the productive capacity of the economy. Let us then define the capital-output ratio as the symbol kappa \\(\\kappa\\).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{15}\n\\kappa = \\frac{K}{Y}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis then gives us a path to a different accumulation equation involving the KY Ratio when looking at \\(\\dot{K}\\) as a growth series \\(G^{K}\\) by first altering (4) to (16)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{16}\nG^{K} = \\frac{s}{\\kappa} - \\delta\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAnd second by using the \\(G^{Y}\\) that was previously derived. Using these two we can derive \\(G^{\\kappa}\\) given that\n\\[G^{\\kappa} = G^{K} - G^{Y}\\]\nGiving us\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{17}\nG^{\\kappa} = (1-\\alpha)(s(n+g+\\delta)\\kappa)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIntegrating and again saving on notation we get\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{18}\n\\kappa(t) = [\\kappa_{0} + \\frac{s}{d}+\\exp(-bdt)-\\frac{s}{d}]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(k_{0}\\) is the inital capital-output ratio and \\(d=n+g+\\delta\\) and \\(b=1-\\alpha\\). To be able to use this to do computations though, we need to convert into a discrete equation.\n\\[\\kappa_{t+1} = \\kappa_{t} + [\\frac{1-\\exp(-(b)(d))}{d}](s- (d)\\kappa_{t})\\]\nThis gives us the discrete solution \\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{19}\n\\kappa_{t+1} = \\kappa_{t} + (1-\\alpha)(s - (n+g+\\delta)\\kappa_{t})\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAlright, now we will use the various equations we gave here for computations. Before we do that we must alter equation (19) to make it stochastic so that we may simulate the real world accurately. To do that we will add a stochastic sequence to savings called \\(\\{X_{t}\\}\\) which will formally be a representation of shocks to a country’s Net Foreign Assets position over time. With that detail included in the solow model, although it is a closed economy model, it will become a complete model by borrowing all the closed economy formalism that was set up in Macroeconomic Laws 1 and their equivalence relations, and with that, we will see, that Macroeconomics is just as deterministic as physics. So (19) becomes (20)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{20}\n\\kappa_{t+1} = \\kappa_{t} + (1-\\alpha)((s + \\{X_{t}\\}) - (n+g+\\delta)\\kappa_{t})\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe can now turn to deciding the method to test conditional convergence. Remember our aim here, it is here to replicate the real world data using (20). We need an objective way to choose the ranges of our random sequences. We will do that by relying the exchange rate performance of any country and its exchange rate regime. We will have two broad ‘scenario bundles’. The fixed exchange rate regime who either appreciated or depreciated. The floating exchange rate that either appreciated or depreciated. All countries out there will fall into one of these categories at any point in time depending on the boundaries you will pick. So we will have four different \\(\\{X_{t}\\}\\) that explains the movement of any region’s exchange rates, via the presets : \\(PA\\) meaning Pegged Appreciation, \\(PD\\) meaning Pegged Depreciation, \\(FA\\) meaning Float Appreciation, and \\(FD\\) meaning Float Depreciation.\n\\[ \\{ X^{PA}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R} :  X^{PA} \\sim \\mathbb{U}[0, 0.35) \\} \\]\n\\[ \\{ X^{PD}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R} :  X^{PD} \\sim \\mathbb{U}[-0.35, 0) \\} \\]\n\\[ \\{ X^{FA}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R} :  X^{FA} \\sim \\mathbb{U}[-0.1, 0.35) \\} \\]\n\\[ \\{ X^{FD}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R} :  X^{FD} \\sim \\mathbb{U}[-0.35, 0.1) \\} \\]\nFor our first test of the model, all countries will have the same parameters, except for their random sequences and their initial capital-output ratios. We will model for 64 periods meaning from 1960 to 2024. This will be our baseline. We are not looking to model the real world accurately just yet. First we must look at the effect that the shocks on NFA contributes in practice to the capital-output ratios’ and we must judge whether this starting point is fair and reasonable to these regions / countries by considering how their prices / exchange rates moved. The numbers will speak for themselves. You will get what I mean in a second. I will be using \\(\\kappa_{US} = 3\\), \\(\\kappa_{SG} = 1.5\\), following available statistics, and will be using \\(\\kappa_{MU} = \\kappa_{SSA} = 1\\).\n\n\nShow the code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n\nsns.set_context('notebook',font_scale=1)\nsns.set_style('ticks')\n\n\nclass Solow:\n    \n    \"\"\" \n    Built upon and modified from Stachurski-Sargeant and Brad Delong \n    &lt;https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/python_oop.html&gt;\n\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, n=0.02,              # population growth rate\n                       s=0.3,              # savings rate\n                       δ=0.03,              # depreciation rate\n                       α=1/3,               # share of capital\n                       g=0.02,              # productivity\n                       κ=1, # current capital-labor ratio\n                       A=1,               # current efficiency of labor\n                       L=1.0,\n                       upper=0.1,\n                       lower=-0.1,\n                                ):              # current labor force  \n\n        self.n, self.s, self.δ, self.α, self.g = n, s, δ, α, g\n        self.κ, self.A, self.L, self.upper, self.lower = κ, A, L, upper,lower\n        self.f = np.random.uniform(self.lower,high=self.upper)\n        self.Y = self.κ**(self.α/(1-self.α))*self.A*self.L\n        self.K = self.κ * self.Y\n        self.y = self.Y/self.L\n        self.g_k = ((self.s+self.f)/(self.κ) - self.δ)\n        self.g_y = (self.α*(self.g_k-self.g-self.n)+self.g)\n        self.g_Y = self.α*(self.g_k)+(1-self.α)*(self.n+self.g)\n        self.MPK = self.α*(self.Y/self.K)\n        self.initdata = vars(self).copy()\n        \n    \n    \n    def calc_next_period_kappa(self):\n        \"Calculate the next period capital-output ratio.\"\n        # Unpack parameters (get rid of self to simplify notation)\n        n, s, δ, α, g, κ, f = self.n, self.s, self.δ, self.α, self.g, self.κ, self.f\n        # Apply the update rule\n        return (κ + (1 - α)*( (s+f) - (n+g+δ)*κ ))\n\n    def calc_next_period_A(self):\n        \"Calculate the next period efficiency of labor.\"\n        # Unpack parameters (get rid of self to simplify notation)\n        A, g = self.A, self.g\n        # Apply the update rule\n        return (A*np.exp(g))\n\n\n    def calc_next_period_L(self):\n        \"Calculate the next period labor force.\"\n        # Unpack parameters (get rid of self to simplify notation)\n        n, L = self.n, self.L\n        # Apply the update rule\n        return (L*np.exp(n))\n    \n\n        \n    def update(self):\n        \"Update the current state.\"\n        self.f = np.random.uniform(self.lower,high=self.upper)\n        self.ts = self.s + self.f\n        self.κ =  self.calc_next_period_kappa()\n        self.A =  self.calc_next_period_A()\n        self.L =  self.calc_next_period_L()\n        self.Y = self.κ**(self.α/(1-self.α))*self.A*self.L\n        self.K = self.κ * self.Y\n        self.y = self.Y/self.L\n        self.k = self.K/self.L\n        self.g_k = ((self.s+self.f)/(self.κ) - self.δ)\n        self.g_y = (self.α*(self.g_k-self.n-self.g)+self.g)\n        self.g_Y = self.α*(self.g_k)+(1-self.α)*(self.n+self.g)\n        self.MPK = self.α*(self.Y/self.K)\n\n\n    def generate_sequence(self, t, var = 'κ', init = True):\n        \"Generate and return time series of selected variable.

Singapore and America still soars, because they move above the threshold of output per worker and KY Ratio where it simply no longer matters, even if corruption plus incompetence is present.

Maybe we should continue to bring real world data in now, in the form of labor for all regions, that we covered previously in the chart on conditional convergence.

Let us also differentiate between the capital-output ratio of the economies so as to be able to reflect the data more accurately and use their real world capital shares. With regards as to how I came to the final numbers, I relied on the Penn World Tables initially to use their KY ratios of these regions in the 1960’s to make the first test runs and IF that did not work, I looked for KY ratios that best reflected real data.

Did you really think it was possible to be 50x more productive in the span of 64 years when singapore was only ~20x more productive.\nIt’s not. Let us not downplay what China has accomplished though. Let’s not do that. It is the single most extraordinary thing of this century. It progressed faster than Singapore. You cannot expect more than that. The amount of people it has lifted out of poverty is extraordinary. Now, if you want to do other countries, you should remember that \\(g = \\frac{\\dot{y}^{*}}{y^{*}}\\) is your potential output growth rate. So for europe it would be \\([0,0.02]\\). In fact if you wanted to predict rather than test convergence for ‘your economy’, you would use \\(\\alpha=0.33333\\) and calibrate \\(g\\) appropriately and use the appropriate \\(\\kappa\\) to get spookily close to real world predictions.\nLook on the bright side. Lots of countries play with numbers, not just yours. See, economics is completely deterministic too. A ahem ahem - how might you call it again? Ah yes a social science.",

The fate of such a country is that it wins its race to zero growth and once that happens it does not generate enough real savings anymore, so it will start to fail to converge to become an advanced economy because of a perpetual cycle of Debasement, Debasement, Debasement, Debasement, Debasement, Debasement, Debasement.. This means that by explaining to you what happened to the Republic of Mauritius, I simultaneously explained to you what has happened everywhere or is currently happening elsewhere in the world in a country that has a low KY ratio, like Lebanon, Bangladesh, Turkey, Sri-Lanka, Egypt, Argentina, Nigeria (The entirety of Africa actually). On the flipside countries with a high KY ratio like Singapore, China, the US, Japan, Europe, Korea, Australia, the UK and most scandinavian countries can always take their debt to the limit by decreasing rates and preventing the convergence to zero growth by pushing rates lower and lower to get close to zero growth but not zero. They do that with what is called QE (Quantitative Easing). Of course it can fail, We failed with our financial repression and converged to zero growth in 2019. But it was unlikely for us to ever be able to do that kind of thing very long. Advanced economies can do this sustainably.

As I told you in the last paper, our country is currently financially repressed as if it were a champagne bottle that still has its cork. Unlike a regular champagne bottle however, no matter how much we shake it, the cork will not go off because the government is also applying force to prevent it, in the form of repressing demand for foreign currencies by having quotas, in the availability of foreign currency just like Russia did at the start of its war. But even Russia could not do any magic, just like here too we cannot do anything about the fact that the currency will have to slide sooner or later. We have been installing a dictatorship in capital markets by imposing herculean capital controls so that it will happen later. We are here now. Later is after the elections. Our country will not hold much longer. Rather than the cork popping off, the champagne bottle itself will explode from the fact that while you can slow down currency adjustment, inflation has been wreaking havoc in our country. We are not progressing as it is right now. Do you understand that? We cannot have economic reliable growth unless we give in to the RER adjustment which is a devaluation of our exchange rate. Plus we have to pay back the foreign currency debt we took. The only reason we are not doing it yet, is because of the elections but it does not matter who wins and who comes into power. They will inherit a bankrupt country. So, what do you do when that happens? You need to raise capital. We will need to be bailed out by the IMF. A lot of things in our country is bust, people’s pension funds, state companies, retirement funds, our central bank way too many things for me to list. The important thing is how you save anything from bankruptcy. You introduce fresh capital into the system. That is what the IMF will provide to us as it did in the 1980s. They’ll probably require that devaluation to even consider helping us, so you know, things are very hard ahead. If the government itself wins, or steals, they might keep the illusion up and then we will head towards increasingly more and more inflation but odds are, knowing what our government excels at. You will get some bullshit story that has probably been already cooked and they will also run off to the IMF by passing the buck. Now, keep in mind our country is not Venezeula or Zimbabwe. We are not different from Lebanon or Sri Lanka though. What you need to realise with inflation is that it compounds and get worse over time. For example to have 90% inflation over four years you need around 18% of annual inflation each year for four years\n\\[ (1+0.18)^{4}=1.938 \\]\nThat would be the equivalent of a monthly inflation of around 1.5% for the past four years for each month that we went through. To become venezeula or zimbabwe you not only need to go to the next level which is rather to have double digit monthly inflation readings but to go even further than that to reach triple digit inflation MoM wise. That only happens when production totally collapses. That did not happen in our country. We are bankrupt sure, we lack around 30,000-50,000 less labor than before sure, but objectively our output should be closing in to our 2019 expenditure peak which is close to where we were in 2012-2015. That is where we are objectively, quasi-stationary for 10 years. Just so you know by the way having 18% inflation every month for a year amounts to how much inflation exactly ? Can you guess how exponential the price rise is ? Its over 700% inflation. We are obviously not at that kind of inflation and we will not get to that.\n\\[ (1+0.18)^{12} = 7.28 \\]\nProduction is nevertheless where the real problem lies today. Nobody is saying it because no one wants to bother saying the truth. WE ARE COMPLETELY STUCK AS A COUNTRY BECAUSE WE DEINDUSTRIALISED. We need to move up in value chains not down. No offense to anybody but you need to stop living in a world where agriculture will save this country because you have been lied to. I am not saying these things are bad, if you want to do agriculture you need to do the capital-intensive kind. Anything capital-intensive is good but capital-intensive activities are really costly as its name indicates. Odds are you will always do noncapital-intensive activities in agriculture unless the government steps in and does the right thing. Help you transition into capital-intensive agriculture that utilizes space most efficiently. Hold your hand and truly show you how to do it correctly with the right subsidies and education. So that you can also bring your own contribution towards the country’s future as well as secure yours. These are nice and good so that everybody can contribute to economic growth. The government should certainly use some of its budget to do these kinds of things. But these things will not secure the future of this country. There is a reason why, the private sector is conspiring with the government to import foreign labor that they can underpay and overwork. That is because that is what they need today to survive. Our country has given up. Our private sector has given up on you. On me. On us. The government did too because they have no idea how to do what needs to be done. We need economies of scale today if we wish to have not only political stability going into the future but also if we wish to permanently go to a higher level of standard of living. We never earned this lifestyle, that we had for the past ten years. We relied on temporary hot money flows which provided us with adequate real savings to fund it temporarily but its gone now. We imperatively need capital-intensive manufacturing.\nThis is not a choice we can avoid anymore. Let me real with you so that you can understand this clearly. Inequality is soaring, and will only get worse and worse and worse UNLESS we have strong productivity growth and continue having progress which is what will allow your real wages to increase again to decrease that inequality. I have already showed you that real wages depend on the growth of \\(g\\) in Macroeconomic Laws 2. The private sector has already found their workaround by just increasing \\(n\\) which will decrease \\(g\\) for every worker and work out better for them by decreasing real wages. The private sector has left the chat. It is commited to its plan. If we want this to change, we can only have \\(G^{g}&gt;G^{n}\\) by exporting a lot more goods and services. Not with villas, not with silly constructions that do not bring a single dollar back here and certainly not with money that comes in only to go somewhere else a week after. If we do not have that minimum wages could be 100,000 Rupees, you will still be dirt poor because government can never give you anything. You need to understand economics and stop living in propaganda. What any government can do is correct a market outcome. If your employer is exploiting by not increasing your real wage even though productivity has been increasing, then government can step in and put a floor on real wages to correct it in the form of minimum wages. That is not without consequence though, unemployment will increase because the cost of labor increased. But if there was no productivity to be had in the first place, all your government’s action will beget is inflation. Meaning, since 2019 there has been no \\(g\\). Minimum wages have almost doubled and your life is much worse than before.\nNow, there are a lot of barriers to us being able to build an industrial base that is capital-intensive. The first and most important one is human capital. I say this with the utmost respect for everyone of course but we are a dumb country, me included of course. That is the only reason why we do not do any capital-intensive manufacturing. If someone knew how to do it, you can bet your sweet ass that they would have done it, given how much money there is in it to be made, but sadly we do not. The government has to legislate around that for us to be able to incentivize a pool of very highly skilled workers to come to live here. Not legislate to facilitate the import of foreign labor to replace local labor in labour intensive jobs. The second most important hurdle in us becoming the core of Africa, is the biggest requirement that a core needs, abundant domestic demand, for economic activities to cluster around it. Now, it is not as bad as you might think given that Reunion and Madagascar are mere hours away. We could very well count them as a reason to cluster economic activity here. So it is not, in fact as hard as you might have thought it should be for us to become the core of Africa. We need to carefully plan for population growth and implement policies that will at least triple the population we have. We need that thing anyway to pay for pensions and to ensure our survival as a country. We then need to lobby France enough with the prospect that Reunion gets to be part of Africa’s core the more they push people to come here which would mean more output meaning more tax for the government of France, if they too would triple their population and we both traded a lot more with Madagascar and each other, our combined demand would be enough to pull a lot of economic activity to cluster here. We are in a region of Africa that is extremely well protected given we have India, the US, the UK and France that technically have our backs at all times. In the increasingly conflict-ridden world that we live in, that can only be a plus. We also need to be serious about education. About not letting kids leave school before 18 or before they can do a rigorous enough mathematics test. We need capital investment into port infrastructure to be able to trade at least 10x more.\nEventually, all of this groundwork would also help us develop the financial side of it after all this is said and done. That is step two though and is a long way ahead. By that point, our current account deficit will have turned into a current account surplus. Manufacturing should be mostly capital intensive and account for atleast a quarter of GDP and ideally around 30%. Intercontinental Exchange will setup a subsidiary here called ICE Africa acknowledging us as Africa’s core. Most biggest banks will have real presence here. We will be a net creditor to the world. The last and perhaps most important thing of all that we need to do is to get rid of our crappy constitution, which is designed to corner our country into perpetual despotism. Of course that is not easy. But it is what we need. Cause and effect wise, this is the only thing we can do as a country to secure our own future. This is about securing not only your future though but the future of your children and their children and their children. What our current constitution has secured for 56 years is the supremacy of some political parties, and the ability of many companies that should have long gone out of business to continue to not only operate but also to thrive. These companies thrive by having their cost of capital subsidized at rates that would make anybody a billionaire. The people’s money has made many men in our country billionaires arbitrarily through not the hard work of those men but through that man being awarded government tender after government tender. Our constitution does not favor competence. It favors communalism. We need to equip ourselves with the tools to be able to secure our future. If the future of the private sector is currently secured via importing foreign workers to practice let us be honest modern slavery, just like your government is practicing regular slavery in the public sector to secure its future, then we as a country if we want these kinds of abuses to stop, we have no choice. We have to impose a new constitution as a country at some point.\n\nI wrote a short but robust one here just to show you how bad our current constitution is.",

You see, these days, Mauritius is just bankrupt. It has been for a long time. But that is the problem with invented governments that has a monopoly over their own currency that they can create arbitrarily. They cannot go bankrupt or declare bankruptcy. Because government can always invent an excuse and print money via the central bank. We call that debasing your currency. Around 180 billion rupees (worth 3.75 billion dollars at 48 rupees/ USD) has been printed solely via bullshit excuses to make up for the fact that the country is broke. But they made the situation so much worse, by printing so much money, allowing so much inflation just to save their necks. You have to understand that. You had to pay a price. You had to starve, so they could live another day. By resorting to money printing our country has basically tied a noose around everybody’s neck.

There are two kinds of people today in the Republic of Mauritius. The kind who gets unlimited access to foreign currency and the kind that has to beg, to be able to send their children money. The worst of it is that faced with this a lot of conglomerates have simply, stopped selling their foreign currencies and resorted to using swaps. They stopped selling because they know how bad the situation is. I don’t blame them. Unlike Moody’s or the IMF, they know what the true economic position is, because they live here.\nNow, this discrimination was always true of domestic currency and still is. There are people in the Republic of Mauritius that always had unlimited access to money and generally at a reduced cost. You can use any word you want to refer to them but crony is a good word.

    "section": "Microdynamics",
    "text": "Microdynamics\nConsider real output in a closed economy.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\\label{eq-a}\ny(c,s) = c_{r} + s_{r} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad s = i\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn a closed economy there are only two things, consumption \\(c\\) and savings \\(s\\). Because of that fact, savings also equals investment when considering a closed economy. Now in macroeconomics, there are two type of statistics. One that is called a real statistic where inflation is stripped off and another one, called a nominal statistic where inflation is not stripped off. These two statistics are always related to each other, at all times. The challenge is to understand how they are related objectively, so that even if the Republic of Mauritius was faking all of its statistics (which it is doing, these days), it would ultimately not matter, because you would not need to rely on any statistic anymore. You would rather have an understanding of how an economy works. You would never need to read an opinion about the economy every again in this life. You would always know everything about any economy. Now, the first step in doing that is to understand how nominal output and real output are related. Consider writing \\((1)\\) in different real terms.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{2}\\label{eq-b}\ny(c,s) = c_{r} + s_{r} \\Longleftrightarrow y(p(c,s)) = \\frac{c_{n}+s_{n}}{p_{\\text{deflator}}} \\Longleftrightarrow y(k(c,s)) = \\frac{c_{n}+s_{n}}{k}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAs you can see these equations are related by the fact that, they all represent real output, but we do not work with real output in the real world, because governments need a get out of jail free card through money printing. We work with nominal output, because economics is ultimately a ponzi scheme based on population growth, where you pay back debt with a little growth and with money being less valuable over time, which is a process that is called inflation. Do not panic, this is true, well known and easy to derive. We will much further down. You see, the belief that government exists to protect your interests is a naive and dumb interpretation of human nature. It is very hard to believe with all the fluff, that government throws at you, of course. But you have to remember, governments only exist, because it remains the most elegant and non controversial way to hold power over the resources of an entire country without protest and competence. All you need is a bad constitution and bad laws for the nightmare to begin. These are both things, the Republic of Mauritius has had for 56 years. We are getting played buddy, there is no democracy, no fairness. There never was, the democracy our parents believed in was communalism. That is not and will never be democracy. Today, there is just you, and me who is too afraid to stand up to the bullies of this country. Back to business, why is it important to understand how real and nominal output works ?\nIt is important, because one affects the other. There are causal relationships here. Cause and effect relationships, which means that, \\(p_{\\text{deflator}}\\) which here represents the GDP deflator and \\(k\\) which here represents the exchange rate, can give you useful information about any economy at any time. You do not need to know real output exactly, you can infer everything from a robust understanding of how the exchange rates, price indexes and output are objectively related. Economics is not magic. There are simple rules every economy out there will always respect. Learn the rules and no one will be able to fool you again. Meaning these are three ways to be looking at the same thing objectively, because all these three equations represent the same thing \\(y\\) which is real output. So this logically means that \\((2)\\) is equivalent to (3).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{3}\\label{eq-c}\n\\text{Real Output} \\Longleftrightarrow \\text{Real Output} \\Longleftrightarrow  \\text{Real Output}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSo even if, any government like the current republic of mauritius fakes all its statistics, it cannot fake how economics works deterministically. If you can understand that, then you are good to go. The biggest barrier to understanding this is going to be reading basic calculus notation. So the first thing we have to do is understand the causal relationships between\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}= \\dfrac{dy}{dp} \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial s} = \\dfrac{dy}{dk} \\dfrac{\\partial k}{\\partial s} = Productivity\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{dc}= \\dfrac{dy}{dp} \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial c} = \\dfrac{dy}{dk} \\dfrac{\\partial k}{\\partial c} = Inflation\n\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSo from these two equations, the first causal relationship that we find is that between productivity and inflation. Productivity is the absence of inflation. An increase in inflation will always be met by decreases in productivity. Now why is that true? To understand that we need to understand the causal relation between exchange rates, prices and real output. We do that by defining the total differential of both price \\(p(c(t),s(t))\\) and the exchange rate \\(k(c(t),s(t))\\) over time to be.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{4}\\label{eq-d}\n\\dfrac{dp}{dt}= \\dfrac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{c}} \\dfrac{dc}{dt} + \\dfrac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{s}} \\dfrac{ds}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{5}\n\\dfrac{dk}{dt}= \\dfrac{\\partial{k}}{\\partial{c}} \\dfrac{dc}{dt} + \\dfrac{\\partial{k}}{\\partial{s}} \\dfrac{ds}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThese definitions have implications, namely that if\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&gt;0= k \\downarrow \\;\\; p \\downarrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\dfrac{dy}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&lt;0= k \\uparrow \\;\\; p \\uparrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis is where we are confronted with the first problem of macroeconomics. Equation \\((4)\\) can be tampered with and is tampered with arbitrarily everywhere in the world. Truth is, everybody likes inflation to be low because every government wants to be re-elected, so there is an inherent bias towards calibrating the index you are using to calculate inflation, with weights that favors, low inflation by design. A slightly different version of (4) is generally estimated using a Laspayes or Paasche index to obtain inflation rates as (b).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{b}\n\\frac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}} = \\pi_{t}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis paper by the US bureau of labour statistics gives a good breakdown of how (4) is estimated. Now, this is not what the Republic of Mauritius has been doing. This is what most advanced economies have been doing, understating the impact of inflation but they do not hide it. All of them have food, shelter and energy components of inflation. Our country has outright been misreporting inflation and a simple proof of this is that there are other price indexes that they did not bother to fake, like the leading indicators of inflation themselves, the PPI-M and PPI-A. The Producer Price Index for Manufacturing and Agriculture. They are the price that producers get for selling their output. Now, companies do not just pass increased costs of production on to you, they need to also have a decent profit margin, and they also need to pass on the cost of higher employment to you. That is why, there are ample reasons to believe that if the PPI-M is \\(50\\%\\) and the PPI-A is \\(97\\%\\) then the CPI is somewhere between the two. What we can say though is that inflation since Jan 2020 to April 2024 is at minimum greater than \\(50\\%\\) and close to \\(90\\%\\) given the PPI-A. I have no idea, how high inflation really has been. But you can make an educated guess. You can come to one with some principles. Notably, that government is bankrupt so it cannot give you anything. So, anything it gives will always fall short of completely restoring your purchasing power. So if we look at the evolution of the minimum wage, you should technically be better off right now, by A LOT. Are you really better off ? No, you are struggling, everybody is struggling, atleast in the middle class because the CPI is completely useless and fake. Which is why there are allowances on top of the minimum wage so the government can try to win elections. All of these things allows us to make an educated guess. Which is that inflation is between \\(90\\%-100\\%\\) for the CPI index for the last four years. Because they gave you that much. They must have taken more, given the country is broke and not in a position to be able to give you anything. We have been living on central bank money for four years now. Since November 2019.\n\n\nPRICE INDEXES VS MINIMUM WAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nPPI-M\nConsumer Price Index\nMinimum Wage\nMinimum Wage with Allocations\nPPI-A\n\n\n\n\nJan-2020\n103.2\n80.7\n9,700\n10,200\n107.4\n\n\nApr-2024\n153.7\n103.24\n17,000\n20,000\n211.3\n\n\nChange\n52%\n27%\n75%\n96%\n97.2%\n\n\n\n\nSo if you are following and understanding this writing, your question should now be, so then what is causal relationship between Equation (4) and (5). Who leads, and what is the cause and effect ? (4) and (5) are intimately related through the fact that inflation or price \\(p\\) is always the leading operator which signals the direction that the exchange rate \\(k\\) will be moving in, all other things remaining equal (interest rates). \\(p\\) leads, and \\(k\\) will follow over time. So this simplifies things, because we can now focus on how inflation works between countries to regulate their exchange rates. The first important thing is the Real Exchange Rate between two currencies.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{6}\nRER_{t}= k_{t} \\cdot \\cfrac{p_{t}}{p^{*}_{t}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis is very simple. An increasing RER means your currency is getting overvalued. Overvalued means inflation in your country is higher than inflation in the other country. Which means your goods and services are getting too expensive. So two things can happen. External demand of the goods and services that your country produces will fall if prices rise too much. Second, because goods are cheaper abroad, businesses will import as much as they can, because they can resell higher on the domestic market with a slight markup. This has been the business model of the country for the past fifteen years. We are not a productive country anymore. We have not been getting, any huge increases in external demand for practically ten years now. External demand has basically been the same. What we have been getting is massive inflows of foreign currency from the global business sector, that has allowed the rupee to stay massively overvalued. Which has allowed us to live beyond our means, for more than practically fifteen years now. But, all good things must come to an end. We cannot handle it anymore. The rupee is way too overvalued these days. It can only be overvalued because inflation is a lot more than the measly \\(27\\%\\) you are shown. The only thing reliable in an economy is permanent production which gives permanent inflows of funds. We do not have that unfortunately. We have not done anything for now like 25 years besides non tradables development. Literally. That is why there is no future today left. What does this mean ? This means something concrete economically. Can you guess what ? It means if we defined potential output as \\(y^{*}\\) then potential output is a function of the RER.\n\\[ RER \\mapsto y^{*}(RER) \\\\\n     \\frac{dy^{*}}{dRER} &lt; 0  \\]\nWhen the RER increases, the potential output of the economy decreases, meaning for any economy out there the \\(\\inf_{U \\; \\in \\; \\mathbb{R}}\\) and \\(\\sup_{U \\; \\in \\; \\mathbb{R}}\\) of the unemployment curve is determined solely and dynamically by the functional1 \\(U[y^{*}]\\). Generally we refer to \\(y^{*}\\) as the supply side economy and \\(y\\) as the demand side economy and define a positive output gap as a situation where \\(\\dot{y}&gt;\\dot{y}^{*}\\). This is the equivalent of saying that you are consuming more savings than the maximum amount that you can generate each year thus creating inflationary pressures.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\max_{y^{*}_{s}} \\dfrac{dy^{*}}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&lt;0= k \\uparrow \\;\\; p \\uparrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\nEquivalently we define a negative output gap as a situation where \\(\\dot{y}&lt;\\dot{y}^{*}\\). This is the equivalent of saying that you are generating a lot more savings that you are consuming every year thus creating deflationary pressures. Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong-Kong are the archetype examples of this situation as are most countries in a recession whereby the economy becomes Keynesian because of this deflationary pressure being constrained by laws, contracts, menu costs (the cost of changing prices), money illusion expectations and political pressure making prices (goods and services, wages) sticky. You can always devaluate \\(k\\) to get out of the stickiness rut because it causally affects \\(p\\) ideally with a few rounds government spending if you are also in a liquidity trap to get out of it.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\max_{y^{*}_{s}} \\dfrac{dy^{*}}{ds}-\\dfrac{dy}{dc}&gt;0= k \\downarrow \\;\\; p \\downarrow\n\\end{equation}\\]\nLet us look at the other side now. A decreasing RER means your currency is undervalued. Undervalued means inflation in your country is lower than inflation in the other country. Which means your goods and services are really cheap. Which increases the demand for the goods and services that your country produces. This is not the situation of the Republic of Mauritius. But it is the situation of Japan. But you will have to go look at that by yourself. Think of it as a good exercise for yourself to mentally test whether you actually understood anything from this paper. Find out what the effect, of the Yen depreciation has been for Japan. Has it increased its exports of goods and services ? Why has that happened ? What is the microeconomic rationale ?\n\\[\\cfrac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}}&gt;\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}_{t}}{p_{t}} =\\; \\uparrow RER \\quad \\cfrac{\\dot{p}_{t}}{p_{t}}&lt;\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}_{t}}{p_{t}} =\\;  \\downarrow RER\\]\nThe mechanics of the RER are fairly straight forward, you take yearly percentage changes in any price indicator for any two currencies you are trying to measure. If domestic prices \\(p_{t}\\) have increased more than foreign prices \\(p^{*}_{t}\\), then the RER increases and your currency goes in the direction of overvaluation. If however, foreign prices \\(p^{*}_{t}\\) is what has increased more than domestic prices, then the RER decreases and your currency goes in the direction of undervaluation. You might ask then so how does the RER adjust itself to go back to its equilibrium value ? \\(k\\) moves up or down. Exchange rate movements is what stablises the RER over time. So while it is impossible to find the unknown function to (5), we can actually use (4) to linearly approximate the slope of (5) although (7) can never be exact (deterministic) because there is no way to find out what the exact annual change in prices truly is.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{7}\n\\dot{k}_{t+1} = k_{t} \\cdot RER_{t}(\\cfrac{\\dot{p}}{p}-\\cfrac{\\dot{p}^{*}}{p^{*}})_{t}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nLet us now do simple examples first, and then apply this thing to the USD/MUR, to show how easy it is to roughly estimate the actual inflation that the country has been going through. Do you know how inflation works ? How many years does it take for a country’s prices to double if inflation is growing 2% every year. If you thought that it is easy, its 50 dummy, well that is not quite right because inflation grows every year. It is not a linear process or \\(100 = 50 * 2\\), but rather an exponential process so your answer would be an exponential equation which takes only 35 years for prices to double.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{c}\n(1+0.02)^{35} = 2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow this is it, this is what makes the difference in exchange rates over time, inflation regimes of every country out there. Lets do regimes called (d) and (e) and you guess how they should perform against (c)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{d}\n(1+0.03)^{35} = 2.813\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{e}\n(1+0.01)^{35} = 1.41\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSo tell how the exchange rate C/D performed? It appreciated? Why? Because C’s inflation is lower than D’s inflation. What happened to C/E ? It depreciated? Why? Because C’s inflation in this case is higher than E’s. What if the exchange rates remained roughly the same within a band of \\([-0.1,0.1]\\) percent for a very long period of time. What would that mean exactly? That the inflation rates of the two countries you are looking at are roughly speaking, similar!\n\n\n\n  \n  Track all markets on TradingView\n  \n  \n\n\nTo be able to estimate actual inflation using this method, you must first understand why it works. Because countries can trade with each other, that means that arbitrage (buying cheap from a country reselling high domestically), will always happen to bring prices of tradable goods between countries to equilibrium. Not the price of services though. A hair cut cannot be traded and will always cost more abroad compared to Mauritius if you are using advanced economies as comparison standards. So to use this method called Relative Purchasing Power Parity, the first thing you must do, is pick a highly tradable good, that is sold worlwide and in huge quantities so that you can assume that there is always arbitrage going on for this good so that its prices are heading for equilibrium, at the very least. Such a good, is the IPhone.\nFrom the current price of the rupee to the dollar, we can assume that there has been atleast a difference of inflation amounting to the order of \\(32\\%\\) judging from the graph between the United States and Mauritius. That right off the bat is more than the again measly \\(27\\%\\) you are being shown which is clearly Bullshit. So the US had a CPI reading of \\(314\\) in May and going back to Jan 2020, it had a reading of \\(258\\). Added to our 32% that gives us an inflation of 53%.\n\n\nShow the code\ndifference_usd_mur = 0.32\nexcess = (314-258)/258 \npartial_cpi_mur = (excess + difference_usd_mur) * 100\n\nprint(partial_cpi_mur)\n\n\n53.70542635658915\n\n\nSo now we can calculate the remaining inflation that the country has gone through based on how overvalued the currency is. That is to say, we can use the RER to find out the remaining inflation that Mauritius went through in the past four years. So remember the equation is the following.\n\\[ RER_{t} = MURUSD_{t} \\cdot \\frac{p_{Iphone}^{MUR}}{p_{Iphone}^{USD}}  \\]\n\n\nShow the code\nmur_price_iphone = 105999\nusd_price_iphone = 1599\nmur_usd = 1/46.69\n\nrer = (mur_usd * mur_price_iphone)/usd_price_iphone\novervaluation = (rer - 1) * 100\ntotal_inflation = partial_cpi_mur + overvaluation\n\nprint(overvaluation)\nprint(total_inflation)\n\n\n41.9807383898509\n95.68616474644006\n\n\nWould you look at that, this can explain the rationale behind the minimum wage increases. If inflation is around 96%, then yes the rise in minimum wages and allocations makes total sense. Because the country has not been progressing so, it cannot give you anything. It can lie and say it is giving you everything, that it has been doing for 56 years now. But the best government can do is restore some purchasing power, that inflation has eroded. Not all your purchasing power though and certainly not, give you additional purchasing power. Now, what about the ZAR. Why is it that the Rand and the Rupee have barely moved against each other? Why is this pair so stable? What do they have in common might we ask that is preventing any big swing in the exchange rates? Indeed, South Africa, fakes their inflation too. Lots of countries do, lots of countries have revolutions coming at some point. You need to accept that if you seriously want to understand the world you live in. South Africa, has had as high inflation as Mauritius in the past four years.\nNow, you should really master what you have learned here. Then move on to the next portion. The next portion uses this portion. It connects to it.",

    "text": "Macrodynamics\nSo far, we have only looked at real ouput growth as increases in consumption and savings. We could in theory be more precise with real output growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{y}}{y}=Y\\;\\) by rewriting it in another form where it depends on population growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{n}}{n}=N\\;\\) and productivity growth rates \\(\\;\\cfrac{\\dot{g}}{g}=G\\) which is more appropriate for analysis rather than savings and consumption. If we therefore defined output growth as the following.\n\\[Y(G,N)\\]\nIt follows that any economy or society will be fine as long as \\(G+N&gt;0\\). However, with enough time, all economies will hit a point where \\(G+N=0\\) will be reached – this is where the society in essence peaks. That point is called the peak debt capacity of an economy. That is to say, that any economy anywhere in the world is eventually fated to collapse from either decreases in population or productivity growth but most importantly by hitting its peak debt capacity. In all cases, both factors will play a part. Meaning even the best economy out there, that can be infinitely productive. Pick your favorite, be it the United-States, Europe, China, India, Russia. They will all be bested by the simple condition (A). The condition will always hold, given enough time, there is no escaping it. Economics does not work, with no perpetually increasing population, it breaks. For now though, that is the far away future’s shit to deal with. We cannot do anything anyway about such a problem. I guess make babies. As many as you can.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{A} \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial G} dG = -\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial N} dN \\end{equation}\\]\nWe can model the peak debt capacity with a logistic population differential equation where \\(D\\) is debt, \\(r\\) is the rate of growth of the debt, \\(L\\) is the peak debt capacity of the economy. We can also make the short and medium run peak of an economy depend on its evolving potential output capacity and that should be self explanatory on its own. Peaking requires a RER readjusment on your side or if you are stuck like Greece was because they used the Euro, you will need expected inflation in the rest of the world to rise considerably. That is to say, you either leave your currency area or bide your time and wait for the inflation of the rest of the world to catch up.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{8}\nY(G+N) = 0 \\Longleftrightarrow \\dot{D} = rD(L-D) \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow \\{ \\frac{\\dot{y}^{*}}{y^{*}} \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\frac{\\dot{y}^{*}}{y^{*}} \\leq 0  \\}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn fact, we can improve (8) by discussing interest rates and how they affect intertemporal growth, real savings and real consumption. So interest rates, are mappings to different real consumption and real savings combinations via the exchange rate \\(k\\) and via interest rate differentials. Interest rate differentials is not an exact science. It depends on a lot of things. But in general, for advanced economies, positive interest rate differentials, will always act like gravity and pull money to the higher interest rate currency and thus appreciate it while depreciating the lower interest rate one. If you are in a developping economy though. Even if you have a high interest rate, you are also an increasingly more risky investment. So, it might not matter.2\n\\[i \\mapsto k(i,i^{*}-i) \\quad \\cfrac{d k}{d i}&lt;0 \\]\nSo suppose, you have an economy with 20% inflation, how do you get it down? You need to increase real savings. What are the different ways of doing that? You can increase rates, so that people increase their real savings and cut consumption. Second, you can grow out of the inflation by growing the economy thus create new real savings. Third, you can cut spending as government and that cut spending would increase real savings. The Government of Mauritius has done none of those things, especially because it has not been expanding as well as has been alluded by the numbers. Which is why inflation is not coming down anymore. That should have been very obvious to you if you understood the first part. The second thing interest rates control is intertemporal growth. If you would modify (8) to add interest rates to it you would get the following.\n\\[ i \\mapsto G(i) \\quad i \\mapsto L(i)\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{9}\nY(G(i)+N) := \\dot{G} = -rG(i)  \\Longleftrightarrow \\dot{D} = rD(L(i)-D)  \\\\\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAll right now if we impose a condition to (9) to be able to model output growth and debt capacity by making the condition, to max (9), we will get two logistic differential equation to model this situation. One where debt increases to reach 100% capacity and where GDP growth races to zero 0%. Indeed, in a world of debt, economics is always a race that is happening everywhere in the world. A race to zero growth. We won our race in Mauritius in 2019 and in doing so ironically lost, because no further growth was possible, without getting rid of a big chunk of our debt. Let me visually show you the graph of the solved ordinary differential equations so you may understand, if this is confusing you. Just to be clear we want to model (10) and a fair solution to it, is solving the two ODE’s in (9).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{10}\n\\max_{Y} Y(G(i),N)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nShow the code\n%%capture\nimport numpy as np\nimport opinionated\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import odeint\nfrom opinionated.core import download_googlefont\n\nplt.style.use(\"opinionated_rc\") \ndownload_googlefont('Atkinson Hyperlegible', add_to_cache=True);\nplt.rc('font', family='Atkinson Hyperlegible')\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n## logistic debt capacity simulation\n\ny0 = [1] # start with 1 percent of debt capacity to go converge to 100 percent capacity\n\nt = np.linspace(0,200,num=1000)\n\nr = 0.05 # rate of increase exp(0.05)\nL = 100 # maximum debt capacity is 100%\n\n\nparams = [r,L]\n\ndef sim_debt(variables,t,params):\n\n    D = variables[0]\n\n    r = params[0]\n    L = params[1]\n\n    dDdt = r * D * (1 - D/L)\n\n    return([dDdt])\n\n\ny = odeint(sim_debt,y0, t, args=(params,))\n\n\n## logistic growth simulation\n\ny_0 = [0.1] # start with 10% growth to converge to zero growth\n\n\nr_0 = -0.02 # rate of decay\n\n\nparams_0 = [r_0]\n\ndef sim_growth(variables,t,params_0):\n\n    G = variables[0]\n\n    r_0 = params_0[0]\n\n    dGdt = r_0 * G \n\n    return([dGdt])\n\n\ny_1 = odeint(sim_growth,y_0, t, args=(params_0,))\n\nf = plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))\nax = f.add_subplot(121)\nax2 = f.add_subplot(122)\nax.plot(t,y)\nax.set_xlabel('Time')\nax.set_ylabel('Debt Capacity %')\nax2.plot(t,y_1)\nax2.set_xlabel('Time')\nax2.set_ylabel('GDP Growth')\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you understand this graph? This graph is speaking to you and telling you as you get closer and closer to your debt capacity your growth will slowly wane. That is extremely deep insight. You should only start worrying when your country’s potential growth (trend) hits sub 1%. Before that, you can chill. So the moment you hit your debt capacity, your economy will peak because it will be forced to save to repay past debts, and will therefore be unable to generate growth, because you will need to cut consumption to be able to pay your debts back. This is a deterministic and unavoidable dilemma if you have no absolute debt ceiling which is always unpopular. The Republic of Mauritius hit its debt ceiling before 2019 and peaked in 2019, but was faking its growth, therefore the debt ceiling turned out to be completely useless. It tends to be like that unfortunately. Most countries today are playing with numbers. Once you reach this point however, you have to get rid of the debt, in one way or another. You cannot not pay. That is generally the problem, because you have defaulted now, unofficially. So, you have to print money either sneakily or using excuses like the Republic of Mauritius itself did in 2019 else you cannot cover your liablities and the cat would be out of the bag. So, a popular way is to inflate it away. You see, it is always better to pass the buck on someone else or something else. That is what the Republic of Mauritius has been doing in a typical narcissistic fashion I guess. Congratulating itself in the way and even going so far as to say that it is helping you. The shamelessness is crazy with these people. They are really just killing your future which is fine for them because that way their future gets brighter. On top of that they come on camera and tell you they are doing you a favor. Sheesh.\nThe other way to deal with your debt capacity is to take it to the limit. Only advanced economies can do this, in a reliable fashion in practice. You need to be productive enough to do this. You see, if we take capacity of the debt to its limit what would the equation spit out? What is the upper bound? Let’s take it to the limit and see by setting \\(L=1\\).\n\\[\\lim_{i\\to 0} L(i) = \\frac{L}{i} = \\infty \\]\nSo, that’s cool right? You can actually hold your own, by hanging on to close to zero growth, by pushing rates down as much as you can. In practice most countries are constrained by some \\(i\\) (the rate which allows the system to continue to operate). The lower your potential growth rate \\(\\frac{\\dot{y}^{*}}{y^{*}}\\) the lower your \\(i\\) will be, the closer you are to peaking. In the real world, you call the action of resorting to lower and lower interest rates using Financial Repression. Most productive economies will tend to deleverage through Financial Repression.3 Financial repression is sometimes also referred to as yield curve control nowadays because financial repression is a taboo word in economics. It can also be called QE (Quantitative Easing) which is a more hip word with good connotations. It is a more smooth deleveraging by capping rates or by using negative ones, decreasing interest payments and letting inflation maul away at the debt over a long enough period of time, which is why any smartduck will prefer it, so they may steal, get re-elected, steal some more, as long as inflation is kept low enough to prevent a revolution. By doing financial repression countries engage in a permanent transfer of wealth from savers (workers) to debtors (capital owners) during that period. Which is why, it is actually the worst of solutions, given you are allowing yourself to take a lot more debt. You have voluntarily and heavily tilted the balance of power. Debt is basically borrowing against, not only future hours of work but its rewards too. Claim too much and you make it impossible for the system to continue to operate because it would be the equivalent of slavery. Finesse is needed to find the right balance. The problem with this method is, it needs a lot of conditions for it to be reliable over a long enough period of time. In that time, where all the conditions hold, you will inevitably overreach and take too much debt, because it becomes ‘’too affordable’‘. It will be too difficult to resist. Akin to taking candy from a baby. If US rates \\(i^{*}\\) rise though, you will get screwed, if raising rates would put you into default. Your exchange rate will thus suffer from \\(i^{*}-i\\) and you will get a surge of inflation. It can still work in some cases. You see, as long as you are creating new real savings, that is as long as there is growth, you can be somewhat fine, increasing real consumption. In zero growth though, you will be screwed, because debt repayments will require you to cut consumption by an equal amount for the derivatives’ total change to be zero as can be seen in \\((11)\\). In addition to that it can be clearly seen that zero growth is unstable (inflationary) over time because it relies on past savings or it has to cut consumption more and more to afford itself stability which is crazy and can only end in revolution. So it not a viable dream to hold on to.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{11}\n\\dot{y}_{r}(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    &gt;0,&  y_{c}&gt;0 \\; y_{s}&gt;0 \\;\\;  c^{r}+s^{r}&gt;0 \\\\\n    0, &  y_{c}&gt;0 \\; y_{s}&lt;0 \\;\\; c^{r}+s^{r}=0 \\\\\n    &lt;0,&  y_{c}&lt;0 \\; y_{s}&lt;0 \\;\\; c^{n}+s^{n}&gt;0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nSometimes even though growth may be positive the transfer of wealth from workers to capital owners might cross a threshold where, it is regarded as slavery. Unfair. All in all, while this can feel like a genius idea. It really is not. It is incredibly selfish. That is the crazy thing though. Anything is better than paying back debt because paying back debt means having no money to steal. Let me tell you, human nature is a special kind of madness. This is the main reason why most deleveragings happen via huge spikes of inflation. You get control on spending then. You can steal public money then. Although if it is not backed by real savings as shown in \\((12)\\), it is met with a different curve of inflation that increases at an increasing rate. Because there is negative productivity (dilution of existing savings) because when \\(\\dot{y}_{r}(t)&lt;0\\), then the only thing that increases are nominal \\(\\dot{c}^{n}_{t}&gt;0\\) and \\(\\dot{s}^{n}_{t}&gt;0\\) which increases at an increasing rate which is what has happened from 2020 to now. Minimum wages increasing 90% is not a normal thing to be proud of.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{12}\n\\dot{y}_{r}(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    &gt;0,& p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&lt;0 \\\\\n    0, & p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&lt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&lt;0 \\\\\n    &lt;0,& p_{s}&lt;0  \\;\\; p_{ss}&lt;0 \\;\\; p_{c}&gt;0 \\;\\; p_{cc}&gt;0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWorse, you now see the dark side of these allocations and the horror it is trying to hide because they are not permanent. What has been happening now for four years is a catastophic deterministic consequence of an economy that is collapsing. This is what is truly happening in the Republic of Mauritius from excessive spending to try to win elections and of course stealing of public money, and hitting our debt limit. Because you cannot be gifted anything when there is nothing to give (new real savings). So, your own current real savings will need to get diluted to pay for this excessive spending and stealing. Do you understand now, why governments gladly take making your lives harder rather than doing the right thing? It is because, this is best for them. For you to suffer. Rather than them suffering, by just paying back the debts and not stealing, they would rather steal, pay the debts and cut your consumption. That is human nature for you. That is why, you have to vote competent people up there. People who will not have to exploit you this much. It is a deterministic result of incompetence. It is impossible for the incompetent to not exploit you. LITERALLY. Now, the general problem with excessive spending is that most people have no hard assets to count on, so when governments print money or devaluates their currency, they cannot get some of their lost value back via price rises in those assets. So the wealth of the lower middle class and the lower class just kind of collapses, when this is set in motion. They lose most, given the upper and upper middle class have assets that can rise in value whenever these things happen. They lose, do not get me wrong but they lose twice as less. Overall though, the deleveraging process will the lower wealth \\(w_{t}\\) of the entire country by \\(k_{t}\\) increasing as evidenced in \\((13)\\) because \\(w_{t}\\) depends positively on real output and negatively on the exchange rate. If you are wondering whether we (our country) are poorer than we were in 2020. We definitely are sadly. Still, they are richer, which is all that matters to them.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{13}\nw_{t} = \\cfrac{ \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} y_{t}}{k_{t}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nYou can literally attribute all revolutions to this recipe, I just gave you. Now, here is the good news, as you know if you max growth via lower rates you will race to zero. However, if you put a debt ceiling up, then you can change the global minimum of (10). That is a quite the good news. Because, what you probably have not noticed yet, is that because of intertemporal growth, there are trade offs involved, in this simulation we just did. Who lived the best lives? Obviously the people who lived in the first 100 periods. So what about the people in the next 100 periods? What do they get? Close to nothing. They were robbed by the people in the first 100 periods. That is how debt works ultimately. This is you right now in the Republic of Mauritius. What do you get? You get nothing because there is nothing to get. The state has already borrowed, the money that should have been reserved for you to make your life better. Your hours of work has already been borrowed against, the money reserved for you stolen and spent elsewhere to help the private circles of politicians and the private sector. All you get to be now in this life is being a slave and going to work, so they can enjoy their lives. Cruel is it not? Your entire life has already been determined by the people stealing public money buying cars, villas, houses. Will you accept that life?\nSo, this spike of inequality in Mauritius right now was caused by none other than the Government of the Republic of Mauritius itself. They knew GDP was fake, given they compiled it that way to be able to borrow more. So, this is a huge problem. Respecting debt limits and knowing what limit is appropriate is a key thing to look at carefully in the future because it is the biggest way to decrease inequality intertemporally for every Mauritian that will ever live. It is equally important to note that repaying all your debts is largely useless. You should rather aim to always be in the position where you outgrow it meaning where \\(g&gt;r\\). Of course if you are converging to zero growth, that will be impossible as it was here in Mauritius for these past 10 years. That is why we ended in this situation.",

    "text": "Le Roi Soleil\nOur fate is strongly linked to the EU because they were the country that historically had the biggest external demand for our goods and services. So, the story goes like this, following the financial crisis of 2008 our trade with the UK took a big hit and dwindled completely over time. That was the first big blow of external demand that we got from the EU, and the second came because of Greece, where the government there was doing things that the Sun King would eventually do here. Fake national statistics to enter the european union. That triggered a crisis in Europe when the cat got out of the bag because this foolishness put the whole currency union at risk, which slowed all of Europe down. Mauritius at the time, relied a lot on EU/UK trade. This negative shock to the EU, put a dent in the progression of steady external demand bumps we were getting from them every year. Add to that US manufacturing finding cheaper alternatives for their textiles needs leading to less external demand as well, and you get what is called a current account reversal. The main cause that led to all of this was the loss of preferential trade advantages when the MFA was phased out and the EU abolished sugar quotas.\nThe EU’s external demand peaked in 2008 and started receding heavily in 2012 rather than recovering. That forced us into a recession because of what we call, a current account reversal although in 2013 statistics were embellished because elections were near so as to not show the logical effect of a current account reversal which is a sharp reversal in demand, and that embellishing has not stopped since today. We did not experience a real sudden stop because although demand waned, hot money flows did not recede from the global business sector (We are experiencing one now though since 2020). The only market we have made real progress is South Africa. So, our trade with South Africa has increased today, so much so that we are very much a periphery of the African core today, rather than our past role of being the periphery of Europe which was clearly short-lived and inefficient, because it rested principally on generous trade deals. Let us see using COMTRADE data how GOODS external demand panned out over time from these sources.\n\n\nShow the code\n%%capture\nimport numpy as np\nimport wbgapi as wb\nimport pandas as pd\nimport opinionated\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom cycler import cycler\nfrom opinionated.core import download_googlefont\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter\n\nplt.style.use(\"opinionated_rc\") \ndownload_googlefont('Atkinson Hyperlegible', add_to_cache=True);\nplt.rc('font', family='Atkinson Hyperlegible')\n\nplt.rc('axes', prop_cycle=(cycler('color', list(['#00308F','#007FFF','#6F00FF','#4C516D'])) *\n                           cycler('linestyle', ['-', '--', ':', '-.'])))\n\n\ndef reformat_k(a,b):\n  if a &gt; 1000 or -1000:\n    val = round(a/1000,1)\n    new_tick = '{:.0f}K'.format(val)\n    \n  return new_tick\n\n\ndef reformat(a,b):\n  if a &gt; 1000000 or -1000000:\n    val = round(a/1000000,1)\n    new_tick = '${:.0f}M'.format(val)\n    \n  return new_tick\n\ndollar = FuncFormatter(reformat)\nthousand = FuncFormatter(reformat_k)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = [[2000, 431,1120,305,8.94,1865], [2008, 709,1460,140,75.5,2384], [2012, 423,1350,236,221,2230],[2015,325,992,264,214,1822],[2019,209,845,202,196,1452],[2023,172,628,175,200,1175]]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Year', 'UK (USD)','EU (USD)','US (USD)','SA (USD)','Total (USD)'])\n\ndf.plot(x='Year',figsize=(11,5))\nplt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:1.0f}M')\nplt.legend(loc='best',fontsize=14)\nopinionated.set_title_and_suptitle('Goods trade collapse over time','')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, remember though that is only goods trade. There is still services trade which has been okay with tourism. But, while the services trade has been steady, except in the covid period when tourists could not come in, the services trade was in no way ever exploding. That is because their capacity is much more restrictive by design (capacity) and quality (price). Do you want to welcome 2 million tourists? Too bad, we do not even have that amount of seats available per year in chartered flights by Air Mauritius. Nor in hotel capacity. Do you understand how services trade for tourism works? It does not explode. It is steady with some growth here and some contractions here and there but there are zero economies of scale to it. The problem with the services trade is that lately, it is faked because of its inclusion of GBC hot money flows, to mask our problems. But you must face reality as it is. There are foreign currency problems in our country because that artificial GBC hot money flow added to services export is not money we can use. When you look at the data crudely, things are just getting worse and worse, total net goods trade in particular. Let’s look at all of this in the next chart.\n\n\nShow the code\ndf = wb.data.DataFrame(['ST.INT.RCPT.CD','NE.EXP.GNFS.KD','BN.GSR.MRCH.CD'],['MUS'],\ntime=range(1960, 2024, 1), labels=True,numericTimeKeys=True)\n\ndf.set_index('Series', inplace=True)\n\ndf = df.T\n\ndf.plot(figsize=(11,5))\nplt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(dollar)\nplt.legend(loc='best',fontsize=14)\nopinionated.set_title_and_suptitle('Tourism and Real Goods and Services Export','Tourism earnings prevented us from going into crisis by giving us fresh savings, until 2020.')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n External demand was really dry for the last 10 years and that would be me sugarcoating things. The damn thing had no progression, there is no other way to put it. This chart should also let you know that net goods trade has crossed a critical point where tourism alone cannot sustain it anymore, so the government is taking loans that will hang over your heads for decades to come where you will need to work like a slave to repay them. We do not even know how much the debts of this country really are today, everything that is thrown at you is as fake as these people these days. There is opacity in the real finances of the country. Now to be able to continue with our analysis of what really happened in the last ten years, we need more data, to be able to go on. I will give you a chart that you may need to come back to periodically, as we move along. I will be applying everything that was in Macroeconomic Laws 1 and 2 by basing myself on these statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\quad\\]\n\n\n\nSo first things first, the numbers which the government has been giving you every year are the production numbers, the expenditure number is what has really been going on which believe it or not is also compiled by the government but they choose to discard it as inaccurate data, and the potential output is the maximum capacity of the economy based on a Hodrick-Prescott Filter. Let us debunk the government propaganda first, before going any further. In 2012, you can see the current account peaks at a deficit of -1.5B dollars. Government claims that from 2013 to 2019 the economy of the Republic of Mauritius has been expanding. Our task is to answer whether that is possible given these indicators. Let us first look at potential output and actual output which here are production estimates. We can see that the output gap widens more and more while inflation is consistently decreasing, bottoming out in 2019 at sub 0% and close to deflation. That is a problem, a country with a positive output gap has to have inflationary pressures. Monetary policy during that time period was particularly loose. Rates were not raised once, rather only dropped lower from 2014 to 2019, and given we ‘presumably’ expanded so strongly. Yet again, inflation never came, which again does not make sense. Third problem, goods and services exports were not expanding strongly as we can see from the trade to GDP ratio, most of the expansion came from domestic activities. However, domestic activities are not ever very productive, unless highly aided by new technological breakthroughs. Do you know of anything that our country invented that could explain these numbers, did we invent a new secret technology in the Kingdom of Mauritius, besides the archaic one which is to blatantly lie to your population 24/7? Someone who works at a KFC in Mauritius where output per worker is only around 8K USD is just as productive as someone who works in DC in the USA where output per worker is over 200K USD. Someone who works as a hair cutter in Mauritius is just as productive as a hair cutter in the District of Columbia. The same goes for construction workers, retail workers, hospital workers, and any non-tradable service you want. Do you understand? Unless there was a strong population surge for the total output of the non-tradable sector to expand, the same people would not be more productive over time doing the same non-tradable work. This is why the United-States can rely on non-tradables, India can rely on non-tradables expansion, China can rely on non-tradables. Mauritius cannot, it has to expand its tradable sector. If its output growth is not coming from more trade with the world, it is fake, unless the working population has massively surged. Let’s check it out.\n\n\nShow the code\ndf2 = wb.data.DataFrame(['SL.TLF.TOTL.IN'],['MUS'],\ntime=range(1960, 2024, 1), labels=True,numericTimeKeys=True)\n\ndf2.set_index('Country', inplace=True)\n\ndf2 = df2.T\n\ndf2.plot(figsize=(11,5))\nplt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(reformat_k)\nplt.legend(loc='best',fontsize=14)\nopinionated.set_title_and_suptitle('Labor Force of Mauritius','You got conned dummy, interpret it yourself as an exercise. Remember your solow model.')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why were these numbers surging in Mauritius? Do you want to know why? Because if they faked their exports, international trade is a double entry system, it would be easy to know. So they cannot fake GDP by boosting goods export numbers. They can misdirect people, using services export which they did with global business hot money flows but even that, it is not a fake number, it is just extreme bad faith. You have to understand that the money did come in and did go somewhere else. Technically, you could call it an export. In good faith though, out of respect for your citizens, you would avoid it and leave it in the BoP. But this is how every country fakes its GDP. Mauritius itself faked its GDP using this production numbers boosting trick in the 1980s when shit got too ugly. Countries make their existing nontradable sectors more productive than they are and that will mess up their trade to GDP ratios. The trade to GDP ratio went below 100% in the 1980’s and recently. That is a mathematical impossibility for a small open economy. It is only possible for open and closed economies with considerable domestic resources. Let’s just prove it.\nIf an economy has to import everything it needs and engages in exports then this economy’s total trade is higher than its gross domestic product. ( Mauritius is such an economy ).\nSuppose an economy has to import everything it needs every year denoted by a list \\(m_{1},m{_2},m_{3}...m_{n}\\) for a total value \\(M\\). Let such an economy then add some value \\(c\\) to every import \\(m_{1}...m_{n}\\) by using it in each sector of the economy and in exports such that total value added \\(c_{e}=c_{d}\\). Let domestic demand and exports be the sum of their respective endowments of imports \\(m_{n}\\) denoted \\(m_{d}+m_{e}\\) which is equal to the total value of imports denoted \\(M\\). Exports are then denoted by \\(m_{e}=M-m_{d}\\). The following inequality thus presents itself.\n\\[If \\; Imports\\;+\\;Exports &gt; \\\\\nExports + Domestic\\;Demand\\] \\[Then\\;\\;M+M-m_{d}&gt;m_{e}+m_{d}\\] \\[Hence\\;\\;M+m_{e}+m_{d}-m_{d}&gt;m_{e}+m_{d}\\] \\[Hence\\;\\;M-m_{d}&gt;0\\] \\[Hence \\;\\;M&gt;m_{d}\\] \\[Hence\\;\\;m_{e}+m_{d} &gt;m_{d}\\] \\[Consequently\\;\\;m_{e}&gt;0\\] \\[Therefore\\;\\;Trade\\; &gt; \\; GDP\\]\nOur country has broken this law two times. That is a mathematical proof. Undeniable proof that the statistics are fake. Once in the 1980’s and recently in 2020. It is important to note that in reality total value added for exports \\(c_{e}\\) are much higher because they involve tradables. Manufacturing for the world rather than manufacturing for your very small economy. Therefore by making \\(c_{e}=c_{d}\\) and ignoring it, the conclusion should not change. If anything \\(c_{e}+m_{e}&gt;c_{d}\\) always holds. The reverse \\(c_{d}&gt;c_{e}+m_{e}\\) implies a small open economy can ultimately progress without exporting which is just not real. This is what the Kingdom of Mauritius basically claims. That we could have higher and higher real GDP without exporting more and more. That madness is why inflation is so high close to 94% after just four years. What you are being told by the Kindgom of Mauritius is not real. In fact this relationship is real telling of economies who are faking their GDP’s because they would have to inflate \\(c_{d}\\).\nOn the flipside though it is good to note that open and closed economies often does have consequential domestic resources which makes \\(c_{d}&gt;c_{e}+M\\) always hold and by a long shot because it does not import/trade as much. Plenty of countries use that trick though, not just Mauritius but that is another can of worms entirely which is not mine to care about. There are plenty of other flaws, in the expansion story, for example, our country has a thriving local industry for food, beverages, beers, toiletries, detergents, soaps, milk, sauces. You know, we do plenty of stuff locally via licenses, or on our own. Why is real manufacturing flat lining then, if demand is so strong? Some of that ‘output expansion’ must come out of these products we manufacture locally. Li p cachiet mo croir non ? Wa li p cachiet. Li pou vini taler la. There are holes everywhere, depending on how well you understand economics. So, let us transition to what really happened exactly.",

    "text": "La casa de papel\nSo, from 2012 onwards the current account contracted, tell me macroeconomically what should be the effect of this? Real savings should increase. Okay, now I did not cover this but this is how it happens in real life, decisions are actually made each quarter in all economies around the world, and the fact that real savings increased from 2012 to 2017 is but a summary of all that. You must be able to know the deeper parts too, not just what goes on at the surface level. At the deeper level, what happened in Mauritius is that in the first quarter of the year 2012, inventories started piling up a lot, which made businesses in general change their decisions from importing more to importing less, which is a process that repeated itself, until 2017. Businesses started importing less because they had too much inventory already, which caused an excess supply of goods and services on the local market with dwindling demand. What does that do? It pushes prices down. Which pushed inflation down from 6% to sub 1% in 2017. What does that mean? Less tax revenue is it not? If you are importing less and less every year because there is less demand for goods and services? So, what does it mean for Government budgets? From 2014, the real numbers were always less than the ones that were thrown at you every budget.\nSo tell me, how did your King, make that noose tighter back then exactly? Do you know how? Do you know what actually happened to your pension fund? The NPF? Your pension fund was the liquidity they needed to supplement their budgets to cover that lack of tax money because output was no longer increasing. Indeed, you financed your own suffering unbeknownst to you. Now is this a crime? Not really, plenty of countries do this rather than raising taxes. France did it which is why it had to reform its pension to be able to accomodate the deficits it accumulated because of financial repression by pushing the age of retirement up. But they did it with finesse, so they do not ruin their pension holders’ future. If they ruined the pension holder’s future then yes, that would be a serious crime. That crime happened here in Mauritius. Your future was stolen using financial repression.1 The NPF was recklessly destroyed by the government, who used it to fund their cheaper lower interest debt that they issued themselves at rates they commanded and forced the NPF and Commercial Banks to buy because they could no longer afford to pay regular interest rates because the economy was no longer progressing. Its effect was a permanent transfer of wealth from you the worker to the government. Just like that. Poof.\nExamples of financial repression can be found here, here, here. Those are the government’s examples which are public but their cronies received the same treatment it seems. They got your money to play with for free. Now, it does seem that things are much worse these days though. I thought only the MIC was reserved for cronies as evidenced here. To my dismay, I read in a newspaper recently that your NPF money is not only being used by the government to fund its cheap debt, it is also being used to help the government’s cronies. Government is using your pension money as if it were their’s, risking your future and your retirement in the process for quid pro quos. They are allowing people to use your NPF money without paying any interest or without demanding any collateral which is the gold standard in REPO transactions involving financial institutions, so as to insure against this silly behavior. Then again our King probably does not even know what a REPO transaction is, a King after all needs not know anything. Plus we are living in the Kingdom of Mauritius. So who gives a damn about your hard-earned money and your pension. Your life’s sweat is of no importance to your King it seems, given how irresponsibly his royal subjects have been handling it. Be grateful that your King is even giving you anything I guess. Gotta give props to Statistics Mauritius though, for doing their work honestly at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\quad\\]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\\[Y =K^{0.53}AL^{0.47} \\quad \\bar{\\alpha}=0.53 \\quad average(1960-21)\\]\n\n\n\nUnfortunately though as you can see, the NPF money was not enough anymore to push inflation in the economy given the amount of contractions, so our King forced the hands of state companies now, engaging in even more financial repression, by getting them to start investing in low rate treasury bills so he may again cover the difference between what is in the budgets that they showed the population and what is the true financial position of the state in reality, because they wanted to increase government spending now thus increasing demand. You see, government revenue was always lower in practice than it had been made out to be from 2014 and this also means government spending was lower too. That is why, there were no inflationary pressures till 2017 where the primary balance started deteriorating and inflation started going up. Always remember your identity of max savings for the supply side to know when inflation should go up or down, given the government is the demand side, a negative primary balance will always be inflationary and a positive primary balance will be deflationary or disinflationary. You do not have to know where the supply side economy is or how high potential output is. All you need to know is that the supply side through economic growth can create X amount of new savings every year. If you spend more, you will create inflationary pressure. Before 2017, as evidenced by the current account flatlining, Mauritius was actually in fiscal consolidation and was not expanding its supply side ( productive capacity ) actively so the threshold where inflationary pressures would come in stayed the same. Anyway, you were getting robbed in broad daylight by your government who denied you of your interest, which is what destroyed the NPF because its liabilties over time outgrew its assets by way too much making its deficit become insurmountable. That is the truth, and in the end, things got so out of hand, that our King’s incompetence forced him to use more and more of the people’s money in all state companies to compensate for his own incompetence as well as his elite circle’s. And so, in 2019, they forced the hand of companies who were refusing to give them the people’s tax money so they may have fun with it and even wanted to sell state companies to raise capital. They legislated so that government nonfinancial corporations had to give all of their ‘unused free cash’ to the government. Treasury certificates they called it. There is a fun fact about this mechanic involving betamax which was paid with it. These state companies should be in all likelihood, completely bankrupt because the state is taking away all of their free cash flow as can be seen here. But then they have the arrogance of coming up with shit like this. Sheesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZean Tirol\n\n\n\n\nL’economie est au service du bien commun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa Realiter\n\n\n\n\nL’economie est au service de notre roi soleil et de ses petit copains et copines.\n\n\n\nBut wait, it gets worse than this, much much worse than this because you see in 2019, becoming addicted to power, our King voluntarily pushed our country into bankruptcy just to fool your parents and grand-parents. His action to lift the pension permanently altered your destiny by being the final nail in your coffin. That is what made the liabilities of our country vastly exceed its assets in that year. The year 2019 was the year our benevolent King, not only most likely stole elections like a true King would, but he also dared to touch the most important thing in a society that is the property of all its people, like a true King would. This is what started this cycle of inflation by putting the state on an unsustainable fiscal path forever. He touched your wealth by printing 18 billion rupees, to be able to debase your own wealth to pay for that increase in pensions, effectively giving you nothing while making it easier for the private sector to also pay for your new minimum wages. You effectively lost all the real value you gained for a few months after the 18 billion rupees went into circulation, into the goods and services market. In some twisted sense, covid must have been seen as a godsend for our King and his allies given that it allowed him and his close allies to pass the buck on something else. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. You see, the government ran out of money very quickly in 2020, and you probably did not know that because that was never reported. And so on a fateful day in April 2020, an auction about which there is no information and in which no primary dealers participated because there was no open market operation, ended up happening. 15 billion rupees was gifted to government to be able to benevolently continue to cover your pensions. Such a graceful and benevolent King, that the heavens have blessed us with. This is already 18+15 billion though.\nThat is a boatload amount of money to put in circulation. Do you remember the identity of the positive output gap I gave you when \\(\\dot{y}&gt;\\dot{y}^{*}\\). That is happening here on steroids because our max savings is constrained to be reduced by much more than two billion dollars because of the lack of tourists back in 2020 and other economic activity. You can already see that, this is a bad combination of things, inflation has to go up a lot now. It did, but at the same time real output just kind of collapsed in 2020 and with it the King’s treasury. Our King was now in dire trouble. The NPF was officially bust, because they could not repay both the government’s own debt principals and at the same time cover the liabilities that the government had committed itself to in terms of help i.e pensions etc.. The money was nowhere to be found, so they had to act quickly and decisively and so to the money printing factory, our King went again and ordered a fresh supply of 60 billion rupees and pre-ordered 80 billion as his personal emergency fund which he called the MIC to help his closest associates, to retain their loyalty and support. Yet again another act of disrespect. Our King tends to do that a lot, disrespect the little people, the elderly people, the uneducated people. Seeing the zeros roll in, the King’s accociates let out a royal gasp of relief and went about their usual business, until they noticed that the contraction was larger than anticipated. Tourism was a bigger part of the economy than anticipated given they greatly faked GDP, so they still had to cover some grounds on financing their budget.\nAgain the disrespect rolled in, it is almost a disease with these people because rather than be upfront about what was happening, an income tax became a so-called new pension fund tax to replace the NPF. Not to an educated person though, the educated person knew the NPF was bust when that happened. This would be the millionth evidence of how much your Majesty looks down on the elderly and the uneducated of his Kingdom. That was unfortunately not enough though, because the state was not generating enough real savings, and seriously risked going into big inflation mode because of all those printed rupee notes that were going into the goods and services market (60+15+18). So our Kingdom did what they needed to save their necks. Had inflation snowballed, it would have been impossible to hide. For example, even before I wrote this, everybody knows the Inflation numbers are wildly fake today. It is just too obvious. Prices are rising too much and way too frequently these days. Now imagine, if everybody had known that as early as the second half of 2020. That would have opened the Kingdom to unnecessary risks. Now, that was a very unpopular policy though, because taxes increase savings, and reduces real demand (stabilizing the primary balance), and to be fair to our King, the tax did target the rich but not the ultra rich given the tax was capped. Still you have to be fair and give credit where it is due. He taxed the upper middle class hard. So yet again, in 2021 we contracted albeit very minimally of course because we were already knee-deep into a hole but we did.",

    "text": "Our Destiny\nBecause of all this another problem was emerging now because the financial situation of most state-owned companies were completely in the red because their free cash flow was with the government to help them ‘bouche trou a little everywhere to make the budget not fall apart’. So their employees’ pension/retirement and overtime PV was in jeopardy now. Everything was in serious jeopardy. Still, the Kingdom needed to find new ways to sustain itself, to be able to live another day. It did that by bleeding you and me of the little wealth that we had left. And so began operation ‘met la population touni pou vive lor zot lasuer’. First very early on, by hiking gas prices and petrol prices to capitalise on higher energy prices and keeping them ridiculously high till today, to rip off the population to its maximum but also by adding all kinds of invented taxes, like a covid vaccine tax, an oil tanker tax, a food subsidy tax, and on some occasions our King was so smart that he taxed the tax with VAT because any excuse was a good excuse to rip people off their hard earned money. Our Kingdom needed money and it needed a lot of it and it needed it fast.\nSo, what our King did is an action more formally called pushing a supply side indirect tax on the shoulders of his royal subjects. Such a hidden tax is designed by the Kingdom to take money from you without protest by increasing the costs of goods and services that the state itself provides to you to make up for the fact that it has taken all the money from state-owned companies and that they are all in the red. There are way too many examples of these things for me to list them all to you, they go from post office charges to port charges, to freight charges, the cost of electricity, the cost of transport, the cost of rent, the cost of bus fares, the cost of air travel, the cost of medicines, the cost of processing fees, the cost of administration fees, the cost of license fees, the cost of licence plates, the cost of fines for misdemeanors, basically the cost of literally anything that you can think of that is state-owned, whereby a production cost increase was passed to you the general population to bear its burden because that is why you exist is it not? Do you not exist to alleviate your King’s, aches and pains as well as his private circle’s aches and pains? Do you not love your King as his royal subject? By the way that Airport Holding thing was only taken private for it to be opaque to hide multiple bankrupcies by the way. Clever this King of ours.\nSo, how does it feel to know that your King could not care less about the lack of books, electricity and bus passes in schools because he likes you stupid? How does it feel to know that your King could not care less about the lack of medicine in hospitals because he prefers to help his cronies rather than helping you? How does it feel to know your King ruined your pensions’ and retirements’ real value by ruining its present value? How does it feel to know that all the private debts of his cronies that he canceled in his budget were actually the overtime pay, pension pay, or appropriate cost of living adjustment that was due to you and that you are being denied until the present value of what is owed to you becomes cheap enough through more and more inflation every month? Do you realise that the rupee has now lost 100% of its value over the last four years? Do you realise that means your salary has lost practically 50% of its purchasing power that it had back in 2019? Do you think your King will compensate you adequately in PRB salary adjustments? Hell no, that is why these numbers are faked dummy, because your King decides who gets what. It does not matter what number inflation is really at, 100%, 200%, 10000%. We must be grateful and keep our mouths shut.\nLet’s talk about our central bank now. The Central Bank has been the centerpiece in the downfall of our Kingdom. It has allowed our King to print money everytime to push all his problems on the rest of the population. The insolvency story of our King’s Bank begins shortly after he ordered them to print more than 150 billion rupees over four years. Most people tend to not understand this point, so we should take a moment to understand what it means for a central bank to be insolvent2. What are the consequences of such a thing?. Because there are big consequences to an insolvent central bank, of which the primary is a weak ability to preserve the financial stability of the banking system as a whole but the more pressing one is the inability to do monetary policy effectively which means inflation will forever have a higher floor as its global minimum. This is happening right now in Mauritius. I’ll explain it below.\nSo here is a very simple example of a Central Bank. It has Non Domestic Assets (NDA) also called Net Foreign Assets (NFA) valued at 30 billion rupees, Domestic Assets (DA) valued at 1 billion rupees to cover its liabilities, being Currency that is coins and bank notes valued at 4 billion rupees, Bank reserves that is commercial bank reserves held by law at the central bank valued at 10 billion and policy securities valued at 9 billion that the Central uses as instruments to do monetary policy. In addition to that the central bank like any financial institution is one that can make profits and was started at the beginning as all businesses with an amount of capital and keeps a part of its past profits as reserves while transferring the rest to the state. Easy enough?\n\n\nTypical Balance Sheet of a Central Bank\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n30\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n9\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n6\n\n\nTotal\n31\nTotal\n31\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the central bank wants to “make” a business cycle? What does it do? It creates money and buys FX from commercial banks. This increases bank reserves so they can lend more. This is called an Open Market Operation. It can sell FX too. It has the reverse effect. Notice the increase in NDA from the central bank buying forex from commercial banks and giving them 3 billion additional rupees for it that they can now lend to businesses and consumers.\n\n\n\nBalance sheet after expansionary OMO\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n33\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n13\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n9\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n6\n\n\nTotal\n34\nTotal\n34\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it thinks there is too much liquidity it can issue securities to take the reserves back for a rate of return on that money. Suppose the central bank issues a security for a return \\(r\\). This is also an Open market operation. This operation of increasing securities by 3 billion and reducing reserves by 3 billion again is called a sterilisation intervention because it cancels the previous buy of foreign currency’s effect on the banking system by removing the previous 3 billion rupees liquidity that the central bank introduced into the system so as to not affect money demand or the interest rate.\n\n\n\nBalance sheet after sterilization OMO\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n33\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n6\n\n\nTotal\n34\nTotal\n34\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let us do an example where our King comes and orders an amount of \\(x\\) billion rupees to be handed out. You were lied to a lot here again because your King just does not respect you. You were told that 2 billion dollars of NDA (US T-bills) were sold to fund the MIC. That was not the case. None of what you were told was true. What happened was accounting tricks which if they were to come back to bite us in the ass would put a lot of people in prison for using these tricks. SVB used this trick and was fine until they were not. One fact, I must share with you is that your King plays hard and quite honestly a good game when he uses his strengths that is lying. Using fake statistics and using fake valuations. Your King is a master manipulator and a narcissist of epic proportions. Did you know, that not all the foreign assets of the Kingdom of Mauritius are in dollars? Revaluating them periodically can thus be a huge pain in the ass because of FX movements. Somehow, though our Kingdom knew the exact numbers to devaluate our rupee to so that ‘the reserves’ would shoot up the exact amount that they needed. Pssst… it did not. They just re-evaluated it as much as they needed to. Let me show you how easy it is to do it. We go from setting up the groundwork from this. Over evaluate the assets with some depreciation as misdirection to allow a new arbitrary number and a plus to also deleverage from debt. In fact, any excessive overvaluation of our NDA (NFA) as was done in June 2024 should have you be worried because it is the first step that precedes any order that our King places at his personal money factory. It seems that our King might proceed with his usual disrespect, by giving you printed money yet again to try to fool us the slaves of the Kingdom of Mauritius ahead of elections. \n\n\nBalance sheet after overvaluation exercise to print money\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n83\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n56\n\n\nTotal\n84\nTotal\n84\n\n\n\n\n\nTo then give the reserves to government. It is totally possible that this happened again when they closed their accounts to declare the revaluation as profits in June 2024, to then transfer a handsome amount of \\(x\\) billion of fresh rupees. There is a lot of opaqueness today. Without balance sheets we cannot know why assets were over re-evaluated to close off the financial year. In anycase though if more money is printed and introduced in the goods and services market, all you will get is a lot of inflation and a whole lot of nothing when you go buy your groceries.\n\n\n\nBalance sheet after gifting revaluation profits to Government\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n83\nCurrency\n4\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n56\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n*\n\n\nTotal\n84\nTotal\n84\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean it is a little more complicated than that, but as I told you a King needs not know anything. The ‘Casse tete’ of cooking shit up to make this look normal is not our King’s problem, it is the audit team’s :D. Now our Kingdom was already in a dire position in 2015 after government killed the second biggest conglomerate in the country, so our King divided his bank’s assets strategically to earn the best return for himself as early as early as 2015 from 2014. Unfortunately, that made him quite illiquid because with liquidity came low returns and given that low returns were bad for our Kingdom, our King’s bank delegates avoided them. So here is how it goes, you can divide your NDA into two categories, an Available For Sale (AFS) book used for short-term securities or what you would call cash or cash equivalents in an accounting class and a Hold To Maturity (HTM) book of which longer duration securities with longer maturity profiles that are more exposed to interest rate risks are a part of. So, after gifting our government with a considerable amount of money, our example central bank reached the point where suffering a loss, almost any loss woud make its equity negative. So let us look at that by going to the next financial year.\n\n\n\nBalance sheet after suffering a loss which wipes all equity\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nHTM\n58\n\n\n\n\nAFS\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n40\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nLoss\n(3)\n\n\nTotal\n80\nTotal\n81\n\n\n\n\n\nIts not that bad right. I mean when you look at it for what it is, everything seems completely fine, sure our central bank now has negative equity in this financial year and is also technically bankrupt but a central bank has the monopoly of money, it cannot go bankrupt, it can just print itself as much capital as needed, which is what it did and why balance sheets are not just never published regularly anymore. So what will generally happen by the next financial year is a good cooking session to recalibrate everything to get the assets up.\n\n\n\nBalance sheet after cooking exercise to hide negative equity\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nLiabilities\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nNDA\n\nCurrency\n4\n\n\nHTM\n60\n\n\n\n\nAFS\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n10\n\n\nDA\n1\nBank Reserves\n10\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Securities\n12\n\n\n\n\nOther Liabilities\n46\n\n\nAssets\n(Billions)\nEquity\n(Billions)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\n2\n\n\n\n\nReserves\n0\n\n\nTotal\n84\nTotal\n84\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it, ni vu ni connu, everything is fine, or is it? Let us go back for one second. While our assets side and our liabilities side technically match. If we mark-them-to-market would its value increase or decrease? Are there unrealized profits or unrealized losses awaiting in the near future? There are vast unrealised losses in the hold to maturity book of our Kingdom. Not just because we overvalued these assets. More so because these assets are of a bigger duration profile and are thus very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Small changes in interest rates can cause big swings in valuations. We got the biggest interest rate swing in practically the last 20 years in the last two years considering interest rates jumped from 0% to 5.5% in the United States. That makes for a lot of unrealised losses. Again, that is why SVB was also caught with its pants down. The domestic MIC assets suffers from the same problem because the bonds it subscribed to were at very unfovarable terms giving us yet again a big hole in the balance sheet if it were marked-to-market. So let me be as clear as can be. The lying, it is everywhere in this Kingdom you live in. In planting drugs, in fake allegations, in fake reasonable suspicion arrests, in fake statistics, in fake everything, and that includes the fake position of our central bank and of our Kingdom’s Net Foreign Assets position. Our Net Foreign Assets position is shrinking obviously. Because we do not have a lot of these so-called assets if we mark them to market. Our Net Foreign Assets position has only ever been in this place once before in the 1980’s. That is why we have foreign currency problems. Unfortunately, macroeconomics is deterministic and the cause of the foreign currency problems is the same as the one in the 1980’s, a dramatic drop in our NFA if we were to mark them to market. Meaning there are a lot of unrealised losses, that our King’s bank is sitting on. Just so you get a visual idea, I’ll show you the transition in the 1980’s where we got saved by taiwan and hong-kong manufacturing coming in for textiles. There is nothing this time. We are on our own. No one is coming to save us from our incompetence.\n\n\n\n\\[\\quad\\]\n\n\nSo, is that it? I wish it was, but you have to realise that when a country goes bust, there is only one way to get out of that problem, it is to have productivity. We have been living on an overvalued currency supported by massive inflows of foreign currently in the global business sector for 10 years, not on productivity. We have not had that for a while now. We do not even have the adequate labor force today. We are not progressing, do not fool yourself. I just showed you that number earlier. What we have been doing is solve problems temporarily but it always snowballs into another problem. Take the Foreign currency problem, there is a very hardcore financial repression established in our Kingdom today, because if you go to change your rupees into dollars because inflation has been so high for the past four years, that is it. Government crumbles. We cannot have that, so you have to force a dictatorship where you have to even go as far as intimidate people, to discourage them from doing what is best for them as Russia did initially when it went to war with Ukraine. We are not allowed, we are slaves, and that is to be our destiny, that is final. Our King has decided. Only his cronies gets access to this country’s foreign currency to protect their wealth. There are other problems, like the money that the central bank printed. It printed a lot of it. But in 2022 when US rates started increasing, it had to follow it, and raise rates because not following it would cause capital flight, which happened nevertheless, but more would have happened. The problem is it has printed way too much money. You do not realise it, but the central bank prints a lot of money these days to just do monetary policy because it has negative equity. It was never properly recapitalised because government itself is bust and does not have the capital (savings). To be able to raise interest rates, you have to use demand and supply mechanics. You have to decrease the amount of money in the banking system, but guess what? Their stupidity has become too costly. Just for June 2023, the cost for only the excess printed money, was as follows\n\n\nShow the code\nseven_day_cost = (0.045 *363510)/12\novernight_deposits =  (0.035*104095)/12\n\ntotal_interest_excess_money = seven_day_cost + overnight_deposits\n\nprint(total_interest_excess_money,'additional million rupees to print per month i.e 1.666 Billion Rupees')\n\n\n1666.7729166666666 additional million rupees to print per month i.e 1.666 Billion Rupees\n\n\nBear in mind, that does not include all the other already existing monetary policy instruments. They have to print money for that too to pay their interest or principals if they do not reroll them. In the end, they could not handle it, the amount of interest payments was snowballing because interest compounds and is an exponential thing that can quickly get out of control. They would have had to sell dollars to remove it from circulation, dollars we do not have. So they just stopped completely. To hell with monetary policy. Do you understand, the hard and cold fact is that the destiny of the rupee is to depreciate in the short run more and more and more because not only are we not productive, we have created a complete shit show with our national currency. Everybody’s property. We are adding too much extra money in circulation when doing monetary policy for the monetary politicy itself to ever work. Deterministically thus, we cannot have low inflation anymore or a stable currency. We cannot do monetary policy correctly and have not been doing it correctly for a while. We have taken a lot of foreign debt because the bank’s Hold to Maturity book is untouchable because of its unrealised losses that one would shudder to even look at. We will need to buy foreign currency at some point in the future to pay those loans back and to do that we will devaluate the rupee through our central bank buying a lot of dollars to pay those loans back. That is not everything, the penultimate disrespect is that, whilst the key rate is being kept at 4.50% so that banks can rip you off, on your variable interest rate loans, the Kingdom of Mauritius has already loosened monetary policy since July 2023. It has stopped issuing 7-day t-bills at 4.50% because it cannot afford to pay the interest. It’s too much for your Kingdom, given it is already bankrupt. But hey, it’s okay to let banks eat away at your salary and keep the key rate at 4.50% because such is our destiny buddy. All of this is our destiny. People like to wonder why young and talented people are leaving this country. It is because they know, and they have acknowledged reality as it is and left because there was no future here. They knew what their fate was. We are all the ultimate suckers in all of this because ironically in the biggest twist of fate, our Kingdom today is the one running a Ponzi scheme. It is removing money from one place to pay someone else whilst not paying someone else. Somebody’s NPV will need to take a big hit in the end. Guess who is not getting paid fairly. It is us, the peasants, the ultimate suckers of the Kingdom of Mauritius because such is our fate. We will foot the invisible bill of incompetence as we have every year for 56 years.",
