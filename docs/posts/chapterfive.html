<section id="what-is-a-word" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-word">What is a word ?</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered about what a word really is? Why do they exist? What do you think came first? The words that you write every day or the human being that wrote them? Did the words and alphabets of each language exist 500 million years ago? The answer to that is of course a big old <strong>NO</strong>. We human beings invented the languages we use. One might then ask, well how do we know that a computer ought to be called a computer, or that the sun ought to be called the sun? Why not call it Bob, I would fancy that. Let’s all call the sun Bob from now on. Why do we not do it? You very well could, nobody is stopping you but most people would not understand you because their brain would not map Bob <span class="math inline">\(\longrightarrow\)</span> Sun. They would map Bob <span class="math inline">\(\longrightarrow\)</span> name of a person. You ever look at a color? Your brain will tell you the color you are looking at although there is no rationale for why red maps to what we perceive as red.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>So why does this happen? It happens because your brain is trained like a lab rat to learn these mappings through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_9X8PVlfBE">art of language learning, vocabulary learning, and sentence writing.</a> We have developed languages with words, then with the alphabet to be able to convey meaning to ‘stuff’ that exists subjectively and objectively. We tend to follow those languages to a tee. That is after all why they are effective tools of communication in the first place. First inside your house to learn the basics but then you are sent to school, all around the world, so that other maps may be accessed and learned through all the subjects that we have in school. The very nature of this subjectivity that each brain is privy to is why lots of countries love indoctrination and why the social sciences are so nonlinear. Human behavior is filled with all kinds of nonsense that determines said behavior which is why it is quasi-impossible to predict, although it is nevertheless deterministic. Education is therefore a double-edged sword because education and indoctrination are two sides of the same coin. You can provide your people with reliable information about the entire world by sharing all the best available knowledge that mankind has at its disposal through the process called teaching in schools, colleges and universities or you can use it to your advantage to raise a lot of sheep by altering things here and there. In Mauritius, a simple example is the fact that there is a clash of words today among the older population and the younger population. That is because words like Democracy, Fairness and Merit mean different things to both groups. So a good objective definition of what a word is that it is.</p>

<p>A word is a placeholder for our brain which maps its perceptions of the world to it so that it can be used as a tool of effective communication. Words can be used to convey subjective and objective perceptions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ah so salty! Ah so sweet! Have you ever thought if there is such a thing as salty and sweet <strong>independent of us as human beings?</strong>. A cat for example, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2005/07/25/4766556/cats-cant-taste-sweetness-study-finds">does not know what sweet is</a>. So the answer is that those are both subjective and objective things. Living things have genes (objective part) that allow them to process what we call sweet and salty (subjective part) although in some if their tastebud receptors are not working, then they will not be able to perceive what sweet and salty is. That is an objective statement. Objective statements are generally based on logic and science.</p>

<section id="what-is-socialism" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-socialism">What is socialism ?</h2>
<p>Did you really need the word socialism to be invented and emerge in the world of human beings to realise that there is an inherent need for fairness in society because free markets although best left to their own devices, do result in a number of desirable and undesirable outcomes? The primary of which among the undesirable ones is inequality and monopolies resulting from profit maximisation, scale and first mover advantages in a market. So, you need government intervention in any fair society. How much is really the question and where populism can sneak in disguised as socialism? Socialism is just capitalism plus the least amount government of intervention required to make society fair. That is the correct and only objective definition of what socialism is. Socialism is always the way to go when you are willing to interpret it in this objective definition. But that is not the definition that is used here in Mauritius.</p>
<p>Before we discuss that, let us understand why socialism is not a choice today but rather the gold standard. John Maynard Keynes in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money">General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</a> changed the way economics is done forever because he elegantly showed a very simple albeit very pertinent point. That markets can stay in disequilibrium for very long periods of time in a downturn because markets stop clearing meaning that there is a tendency for Prices to not readjust very well in an economic downturn to make demand equal supply because of laws, unions or human expectations and conventions that tend to put inertia on the price of labor and goods and services causing them to become sticky. Keynes suggested how government intervention can help by applying “force” to jolt free markets which left to their own devices would take much much longer to clear on their own (Get the right price adjustments to happen so demand equal supply). That force was fiscal stimulus and programs that put a backstop on aggregate demand like unemployment insurance or programs that decreased inequality that provided a consistent flow of fiscal stimulus so as to always keep the economy at a fair equilibrium with programs like food stamps. Add to that free education, anti-trust laws, general competition laws, regulations for food, health &amp; safety and universal healthcare as well as some minor other things I may have missed and you have most modern economies in the world except the US I guess.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-couyonne-lepep-ism" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-couyonne-lepep-ism">The Couyonne Lepep-ism</h2>
<p>Objectively the couyonne lepep-ism is not something that is only prevalent in Mauritius. It is a fan favorite among all governments in the world. Just like the UK washes its sins in Bharat by rewriting history in its A-Level curriculum, or the USA washes its sins of the genocide it committed early in its manifest destiny era which was a major inspiration for Germany and its subsequent horrors, which was only following America’s tradition of eugenics and mass massacre, to begin with. The thing to keep in mind is that nothing is truly as it is told when it concerns history. Human beings have biases and that will affect how human history is depicted by governments based on their self-interests. A tyrant will be a hero if self-interest calls for such a thing to be the case. The world is a horrible place, but it is that which makes the momentary peace we can secure every now and then that much more enjoyable. If you want to have an objective opinion of the world, you can only have one by understanding the science that rules the world. Science will not lie just as Human Nature will not lie. Why is capitalism so successful? Because capitalism is the only objective description that a society can truly have. Any other is subjective. All societies run on greed which is dominated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spgdy3HkcSs">gilded ages</a>, and then are followed by small periods of great equality before going back to a rinse and repeat. Man is flawed. There is no good or bad. There is only good and bad. This is what the older politicians in our country do not get. Science has you beat.</p>
<p>You are not different. You are not that one political party that is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine">political machine.</a> Because that is what all political parties are. That is the science. Human beings if nothing else will always excel at being human beings. That is the problem in Mauritius. Acting holier than thou with the younger generation, when all of us know that what is required in Mauritius is not the perfect politician but just for the god damn laws to work. There are an incalculable amount of people in Mauritius doing obstruction of Justice and aiding and abetting everyday by not investigating anything that is sent to them. You think all the young people of this country do not know that? How dumb do you think we are? Now, one will perhaps ask, well is the world communist then? The answer is if they meet one condition then yes, any country with big government, just has way too much arbitrary human bias that rules them. It can only be inefficient. The problem with the public sector is there no risk to anything if the laws stop working like in our country for example. But plenty of countries have that too. When that happens, you are done, you can no longer pretend to be a socialist economy. You are a communist country. When laws stop working, its no longer about being a welfare state, its about being a mafia state.</p>
<p>The problem in Mauritius is the hoarding of its capital. You see, the capital-output ratio and the capital-labor ratio is low in Mauritius, which means that, the price of capital is consequently high and real wages are low, but take a country like China for example. Even though it is a communist country, it does not matter, because its KY ratio is so high, the price of capital is cheap, meaning there is relatively low barriers to entry finance wise. Likewise any other advanced economy in Europe that has big government will have the same characteristic. So there is a lot more competition in those countries. We want that to happen in Mauritius. But it has not happened. The one player that was doing it which was BAI was killed. You have to realise this, I do not care about that guy, but facts remain facts, his company was destroyed because they did not agree with his way of running things. He was pro competition which the rest of this country is heavily against. Which is why, they pulled out their capital by working together conspiring to take the man down. The man, did not die though, that is the part most do not understand. There was no ponzi of any kind. He had more capital than they could have imagined, their plan failed pathetically. So, they panicked and revoked the licence of this man, I do not know anything about, to rather retort to bullying him and make him go through hell when their conspiracy failed by lying about a ponzi.</p>
<p>These people are not your friend, you need to realise this. If you were to become that man tomorrow, your fate would not be different if you were not part of this incest club of Mauritius. Screaming democracy! democracy! does not make a country democratic. We need free capital markets which are looking to make the best buck not a bunch of insecure wankers who have to make your life miserable just to they can maintain their lifestyles. We need trillions (overtime) of dollars of capital to make this country democratic. We can have it, if you start choosing competent people. We have to privatize most state owned companies to bring huge amounts of capital in. For example, the CEB has to be privatized, ideally giving the buy to a US company who has good relations with a refiner like exxon mobil. The plan has to be to refine and produce lots of stuff here to export. Madagascar lacks electricity coverage. We can export electricity to them. We can export to reunion. We’ll have huge economies of scale, and huge costs savings and that will be our way into capital intensive industrial manufacturing. But in all of this, besides you the people of the Republic of Mauritius, nobody profited. These wankers get nothing in all of this if it happens. Which is why it will never happen. No political party or wanker gets anything from this. Only you and ironically, you are the only who has not been choosing you for 56 years.</p>
<p>Do you even realise what reliable electricity access would do for madagascar? People in this country always moan, we must do agriculture, but why should we when there is a country that has a thousand times our arable land. Why should we do the agriculture when they could do it and we would do the better thing (the core activity rather than the periphery activity) and just buy the agriculture from them with our export earnings of electricity. Do you even realise that this is just one example of how I am different from those people. But its already all in my head. This country in my head is already an advanced economy and in a Second Republic. My vision for this country is not farfetched, we can become the core of Africa. We can have a country where anybody can become president, where anybody can become the richest, where everybody has a bill of rights protecting them, where we can have the Mauritian dream exist for everyone after 56 long years. We can become the industrialised economy of this part of the world. All of this very doable and all you need to do is let the competent come in and do what is best for their country. I do not mean to be disrespectful, but the politicians in this country are extremely dumb and incompetent. They cannot do this for you. They have treated you as slaves for 56 years now. Do you even realise how twisted what I just explained to you is. How toxic and xenophobic these people are under the covers. You live in a prison. This country is a fancy prison where only two people can become prime minister. This country is a prison where only a handful of people can become the richest. You could count them on your hand. Is that normal to you. How the fuck is that normal?</p>
<p>And yet suddenly thse very people are the ones that care most about you. That is a huge red flag. You care about my well-being more than even myself these days, what the hell is wrong with you? Are you perhaps, doing all of this with ulterior motives? Indeed, that is where things take a dark turn. In that, it is not really about helping, what it is about rather is the story that is being weaved. That they are helping us. Just like almost every youtube video out there. It’s about the illusion that they are saving the day while passing the buck on something else! Its the war stupid! Its the coronavirus stupid! But what about where this government could have objectively helped you though? By passing a Freedom of Information Act, for example, so that you could have kept SOEs accountable. It confuses me. Why do you care so much about me and yet care so little about me being able to hold you accountable for your actions? Tell me. Why are so hot and cold? Why is it that we still have National patent exhaustion when you could make my life so much easier by allowing those parallel imports? Why did you intentionally choose to make me buy medicines at 10x their cost and then act sly and coy with me by giving me cost of living adjustment that is worthless? Is it because you care about me or do you just want to get on my ballot paper? Which is it, my love? Why do you sell this country’s state land for chump change to yourself and then resell it for a quick buck my love? Is that because you care about me too? Why are you not paying my overtime then love? Are you that big a narcissist?</p>
<p>Are you perhaps cheating on me love with the private sector? Are you having an affair with them for 10 years now but pretending to be in love with me at the very end to use me? Did you honestly think that I was not aware of it? That I am like my parents, that I run on communalism and fake promises? Be honest with me love, you secretly look down on me, like you looked down on my parents for 56 years, do you not? You think you are fooling us, like you fooled our parents? I mean how else could you so proudly tell me you are increasing my wages when we both know objectively all you are giving me is more misery and more inflation because there is nothing to give? How else could you tell me that even though life is only getting harder, I am supposedly living a good life? Your gaslighting is getting out of control love. You are suffocating me. I cannot even look at you anymore. Everything is gone is it not? Spent in your little love tryst with your cronies, relatives and other mistresses for the past 10 years. You have ruined my future and the future of this country. We have endured and endured for ten years and watched as you disrespected us every day. This is not working out anymore. Stop handing out useless gifts. It is time for the abuse to stop. We need to be free of you. We cannot breathe anymore.</p>
<p>You our oppressors who have single handedly destroyed the dreams of 1.4 million people. It is time for us to breakup. We have no use for you and your love of this country being filled with slaves you can exploit. We have no use for your love of sharing your rent (profits) with the political class so that together you can rule this country with communalism by dividing it. Can you do automobiles manufacturing? Can you semiconductors manufacturing? Can you do electronics manufacturing? Can you do oil refining? Then I have no need for you. You are not essential to the Second Republic, so deny this country its freedom to have real free markets and free capital markets and things will not end well. You are not essential to a Mauritius that becomes an actual paradise because you are all the biggest reason why this country has not been one for 56 years. As for our lovely King. Go ahead and steal. Knock yourself out. We can just <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">appeal the heavens and declare independence to reclaim it right back.</a> We will do it the good old way if you force our hands. Like the US did in 1776 and Bharat did in 1947. We will fight for our freedom from despotism to the death. This country will not be a prison anymore on my watch. This country will become the core of Africa and its most properous nation. Stand in the way of that at your own peril.</p>

<p>On another note, inflation expectations have shot up even more given COL adjustments have gone from 1500-2000 for this year to 4925 which is more than 10x the cost of living adjustment of 2020 which is starting to become scary. Its almost 17x. So cause and effect wise, this increased cost of labor will be passed on in the goods and services fully because productivity naiba - increasing the RER which means the potential output (supply side) is going to go down which means the lower bound of the unemployment curve has to increase substantially. Will we contract again? We very likely will but it also means elections have to be this year, because inflation is getting out of control and you cannot raise the key rate, that would be a death sentence. By mid september the population should be showered with central bank money, and parliament should be dissolved before 9 Oct to go for elections quickly before inflation becomes too big a problem. So predictable though. Pity.</p>

<p>I never thought I would have to write something like this but there is a facebook page called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61562497637602">Pulse Analytics</a> that is using revolutionary machine learning technology to conduct sentiment analysis for the upcoming election in Mauritius. This is a good test for you. Tell me why it is pure propaganda and something you should absolutely not care about? Because such a revolutionary technology would never come to Mauritius. That is just common sense and logic. It would go to the USA to find a VC and these people would become billionaires in a month. It is only coming here because it is a scam which has nothing to do with machine learning but mostly to do with graphic design. There is no technology else the technology would not come to Africa, the least innovative continent. They are a government stooge. Literally everything published by that page is a lie. They are literally running ads, like could you be more obvious that this is a political page? I can already predict what it will publish. No need for machine learning or AI. The closer you get to the election the better Government will magically fare. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IJRfYvgow8">NO.</a></p>
