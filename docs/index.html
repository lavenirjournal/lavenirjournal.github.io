<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-the-people-of-the-republic-of-mauritius">TO THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS</h2>
</section>
<p>You are being told that the coming election is the most important one since our independence but no one is bothering to tell you why. Politicians do not respect you enough to be real with you. You are deemed too ‘dumb’ to ever realise that you are not being told, what is truly going on in your own country. However, Mauritius is very different today, there are plenty of people of reason in our midst, who are probably curious about the objective truth. At its core, the problem is the age-old one that has always plagued the country for 56 years and has to do with competence.</p>
<p>The casual observer of politics in Mauritius will often refer to that problem as the dynasty problem of Mauritius. The dynasty problem while very real is not well defined using the word dynasty. A better and much more accurate word is what in the United States we would call Nepotism Babies henceforth called nepo babies. Now, nepo babies exist everywhere, in all professions not just in politics, and in every country of the world. It stems from the fact that every parent will do whatever they can to set their child up for success so that they can further their own legacy and position in society. That is something every human being will always do. Is it not just human nature then? I tend to lean in that direction. You cannot do anything about this phenomenon. It is how human beings function. We just care a lot more about the children of politicians than the children of plumbers or electricians.</p>
<p>Being a nepo baby does not automatically mean success, except in some cases, where the parent is deliberately creating that success for their child in the background. But even then it is not everlasting. While a nepo baby is born with an advantage in the world, which is undeniably true, the continuity of their success depends solely on them. In Mauritius though as is the case in many other countries, that is not really true because we lack the basic foundations of a proper democracy given our nepo babies have rigged the game from the start. The economics of our country are nasty when you know of them. Our nepo babies have cornered the market, given how our constitution and laws have been pathetically set up. Historically this has only been possible because the average level of education was low. The truth is nothing is truly a free market in the Republic of Mauritius, be it politics or any industry. That is a blatant example of there being more than just nepo babies in Mauritius which is what the real threat is. It is their cooperation together as a group that can sometimes be to the detriment of an entire country when they corner it entirely, resulting in a phenomenon called despotism. That is the dynasty problem well articulated. It is not one family or person. It is an incestuous group of people that monopolises the capital (savings) of the entire country.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that many politicians’ careers should have ended a long time ago in a fair market that is working correctly. But they did not. The truth of the matter is that some conglomerates should have failed by now, but they have not, because they get free access to taxpayers’ money at rates that would make anybody successful. On the flip side, it is also true that a conglomerate (BAI) was forced into failure because the nepo babies of this country are in full control of its capital. A rigged economy with a rigged market is called a planned economy. A communist economy. A rigged market has the interest of some few at heart, while an efficient market with minimal intervention to decrease inequality has the interest of an entire country at heart, by default. That is the beauty of capitalism. Its unfairness is a million times better than any populist bullshit you could come up with in the very long run because it is so productive, that the little you will do to decrease inequality will ultimately do more in real terms. We pride ourselves as capitalists, but secretly we really are a communist country that disguises itself as a socialist one.</p>
<p>The setup is very CCP-like in Mauritius with an abundance of SOEs and a government that is a Kingmaker in the private sector and can destroy virtually any company. Which is why we are stuck as a country having barely made any progress for many years now. We gave capital to the wrong people for 10 years. We need capitalism. We never really had it. But if this country is to truly progress, it needs capitalism so that the most competent people can make this country successful in both the public and private sectors. It needs efficiency. For that to happen, it needs real competition. It needs to let bad businessmen go out of business and let the good ones become the richest in our country because these bad businessmen are choking the rest of the population every day with their incompetence. Bad businessmen will always need to attach a noose around your neck that they will periodically pull on to choke you to supplement their incompetence by making your life harder and harder because bad businessmen need slaves. Capitalism when implemented correctly kills bad businessmen. Our country is filled abundantly with bad businessmen because we have never been a capitalist economy. You live in a communist country.</p>
