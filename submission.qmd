## *public service announcement* ---  


*It is time to bid adieu to race and religion -- and welcome competence with open arms. That is if you want the nightmare you have been living in for 56 years to finally end. So, will you cut the rope that enslaved you for 56 years and finally claim your freedom? Do you want to be able to claim the top spot in the private sector with the help of a real free market? How about the top spot in the public sector? How about equal justice under law? You can only have them if you leave race and religion behind. Can you leave your addiction behind? I cannot force you mate. I will not beg you to save yourself after 56 years. I am not doing this to save this country nor am I doing it for you. I am doing it for me. I am here to claim my purpose. The only reason I exist. Why do you exist?*
